department in the world , with 7,201 uniformed workers and 2,230 collection trucks . </s> * *Source : Wikipedia* *Secretly , the Department had a secondary objective handed down to them by the Mayor of their fair city : to rid the streets of any “ undesirable ” creatures they may encounter along their routes . </s> This practice continues to this day . </s> * *Source : Me* The white heap of metal and gasoline bellowed its way down the block , stopping every few minutes as the man in uniform hopped off the platform on the back , and flung black bag after black bag into the compactor . </s> Up front , the driver sat back , easing off and on the brake pedal . </s> His smudged , thick , Department of Sanitation regulation shirt was unbuttoned , revealing a New York Rangers tee stained with coffee and burger grease . </s> The driver turned to the seat next to him , where I was , roommate ’ s camera in hand , wearing stuff way too clean considering the night I was about to have . </s> “

My father was able to raise me and my two sisters here , and now I ’ ve got two of my own , and it makes me feel a little better knowing I ’ m making their home a little cleaner and safer. ” “ Safer ? ” “ Oh , you ’ ll see . </s> Anyway , was that good ? ” “ Yeah ” , I replied . </s> “ Great , so…what ’ s a typical night like ? ” “ I do four nights a week , 8 to 5 , with an hour break at midnight , where me and Danny go get 2 Bros Pizza or something at Starbucks . </s> Danny ’ s been doing this almost as long as I have , and we ’ ve got a pretty good routine . </s> We switch spots every hour , working Midtown for like two years now. ” “ What ’ s the weirdest thing you ’ ve seen ? ” “ Hmmm…I ’ ve got two . </s> During the day , I saw a live ratking. ” “ Ratking ? ” “ That ’ s when like 50 rats congeal together with grease and shit , and they become a ratking . </s> Hundreds of limbs move as one , and more get added on as they pass other rats . </s> Usually , we pass the dead ones that collapse on themselves , but I saw a live one. ” I winced . </s> Rats have always weirded me out . </s> “ What about at night ? What ’ s the weirdest thing you ’ ve seen then ? ” “ Frank ! ” . </s> I could see Danny have from the driver side rear view . </s> “ Get ready , we ’ re coming up on it. ” “ Coming up on what ? ” I tried to smile , but as Frank reached by his legs and pulled out what I can only describe as a bulkier shotgun , I backed away just a bit . \n","\n","number of changes 3\n","the techniques to apply is

</s> It 's not writhing in indescribable anguish in a lake of fire , being entombed in ice , or going insane in an infinite black soundless void . </s> Nor is it drowning in corrosive shit , having your eyes and genitals eaten by maggots , being meticulously flayed by your one true love . </s> eating your children alive as they scream in vain for you to stop , jamming needles under your fingernails just to feel *something* again , knowing that nobody ever loved you , or knowing that you ’ ve committed acts that make you unworthy of ever being loved again . </s> It 's not even the despair caused by the absolute and inescapable truths that your torment will never end , you will never become accustomed to it , and that any attempt to reduce that torment will only be punished by further agonies -- and yet it is so utterly unbearable that you will constantly try to escape from it anyway , recognizing the futility of your actions but unable to stop yourself . </s> No , Hell is *all* of those things and infinitely many more besides , all happening simultaneously . </s> For you see , time and space work very differently in Hell . </s> The viewing screens ( thankfully ) only provide a limited window into that nightmarish world , but if you watch carefully you ’ ll see the same gaunt faces appear again and again as the victim of unlimited atrocities , the perpetrator , and sometimes both roles at once . </s> And yet , while what you witness will haunt your dreams , it ’ s not the worst that Hell has to offer . </s> If you watch long enough you ’ re sure to see faces you recognize . </s> Remember that time works differently in Hell ; its never-ending cycle of agony and degradation traps not only the dead , but also many of the living and presumably those yet to be born . </s> Seeing one ’ s neighbors , friends , family , or spouse suffering and committing unspeakable acts is of course traumatic , and the questions it engenders are far worse . </s> Are their loved ones hiding dark secrets , or is damnation fundamentally unjust ? Either possibility is intolerable . </s> If you watch very carefully , or are very unlucky , you may one day see *yourself* . </s> But you know this all already . </s> What you may not know is that , with appropriate adjustments , the screens can be used to view Heaven as well . </s> In fact , some of the earliest tests looked in on Heaven rather than Hell , although researchers didn ’ t realize it at the time . </s> Of those stygionauts who later discovered Heaven , most were so far gone to the world that they were incapable of sharing their findings , and the few of reasonably sound mind were understandably reluctant to . </s> The problem is that , at first glance , Heaven is virtually indistinguishable from Hell : a boundless orgy of pain and cruelty in all their forms , overlapping and echoing into infinity . \n","\n","number of changes 2\n","the techniques to apply is [5 9]\n","\n","PRE_OUTS eaten\n","Input Entity:    drinking\n","Target Relation:

'' Maggie looked despondent , empty even , as she pulled out a chair after sharing their ritual Tuesday greetings at the start of their ritual Tuesday lunch . Sal had n't even enquired as to her life-long friends apparent unhappiness yet . Looked like she did n't need to either as Maggie continued . `` It was ... interesting , at least . Nice , I suppose ? '' `` Oh ? '' probed Sal . Since the release of the instantly famous website , many technological advancements had been forthcoming . A couple of months ago some smart computery-type-person had figured out a way to send what are effectively emails back in time . Most people did n't get too much sent back of course , because , quite frankly , most people are boring . All the celebrities got some traffic ( though significantly less than you 'd think ) but it was the scientists who got the most sent back . New data on equations and other sciency stuff . It was limited to a short window of a rather convenient 100 years into the future , give or take . One of the first things to come through was a request to open a website up to the public to allow them to receive information from the future , from family or close friends if they happen to have survived so long , which supposedly was fairly common . Sal had n't bothered with it , though it was increasingly difficult to explain the *why* behind that decision . She knew that she 'd eventually succumb to temptation and register . `` Yeah , I read a message . From a girl called 'Julia ' . '' Maggie began to fidget , a smile on her lips but sadness in her eyes . `` Julia ? That 's a nice name . Was she a granddaughter or something ? '' `` Great granddaughter , actually . She has n't been born yet , but she 's Davids . '' A genuine smile alighted upon Maggies face , eyes and all . David , one of Maggies two sons , had n't had much luck with women . `` She sent a small hello , and attached her diary from when she was a child . She said she wanted to give us a taste of what it was like , or , what it will be like , growing up in the future . It was n't very long , I do n't think she much enjoyed keeping a diary . Only covered about four years or so . '' The waiter arrived and confirmed , rather than took , their order . A luxury of the Regular Visitor . Sal pressed on with a question . `` So , why the frown ? '' `` Hm ? Oh . Well . So I read the diary , most of it anyway . But , it 's strange to think about how much you 've done in life , y'know ? How many stories you have to tell , all the crazy things you 've seen throughout the years . I used to wonder how my children and their children would remember me . What stories they would tell , what kind of an impact I 'd have on their lives , even though I was n't around any more . '' Maggies eyes dropped to her hands as she fidgeted with her purse , reluctant to go on . Sal sat , opting for nagging silence , until Maggie continued . `` She does n't mention me , you know . She does n't even know me . Everything I 've done , and I end up forgotten . '' Sal reached across the table to hold Maggies hands reassuringly . `` They do remember you , Mags . She does remember you . She sent the message , after all . '' A tear was hanging onto Maggies eyelash as she looked up . `` No . I have n't been sent anything . I read it on Davids account .

We sat in silence for a moment . `` So , '' he said , `` What was your life like ? '' she asked . I sighed . `` Well , '' my voice was quiet , `` I had a girlfriend . '' `` What ?

I thought he was going to say something , but he just looked at my face . `` How was your childhood ? '' He asked . It did n't take me long to realize that he was n butting in . `` It was good , '' the ghost said . He was n' t a ghost anymore . `` My parents were good people . They had a good life .

'' -- -- -- - I had to go to bed . I woke up . I felt a bit tired . I got up and got dressed . I went to the bathroom . I took my time , and took a shower . I put on my clothes . I sat down . I thought about my friend . He had a bright red hair , and his eyes were green . He said he was my imaginary friend . `` How did you know ? '' He asked . He sat down next to me . I asked him . His eyes were blue . `` We were friends . ''\": '1 1 3 2 2', \"I found the hall , it was a grand hall , filled with ancient weapons , old and new . I was n't sure what I was expecting , but I was excited . I had never seen such a place before . I even had my own room , a room that I could call my own . I walked through the hall to the end of the hall and walked towards the main door . I could n't help but look down at the weapon . It was nolithic , almost like a giant , it had a large , round stone in the center , and a massive handle . The handle was a beautiful red , like a sword , with a round , golden handle . I looked down at it . I knew that this was the weapon that I would wield . I picked it up , and felt the weight of it on my shoulders . It felt like I was going to be able to control it . The weight of the sword was like a weight on my chest , like I could feel the weight on the back of my neck . I took a deep breath and stepped forward . I felt the ground begin to shake , and I felt my heart begin to race . I did n't know what to do . I stood there , looking at the sword , and the world around me . I realized that I was the one who was supposed to wield it . It did n presents itself to me as a weapon of power , and it was my weapon . I held it up to my chest and looked at it , and saw that it was as beautiful as I had imagined . I opened my mouth to speak , but nothing came out . I stared at it for a moment , and then I heard a voice . It said , `` I am the sword of the gods , and you are not worthy to wield this weapon . '' I took my weapon from my chest . I heard it say , `` You are not unworthy to wield my sword , but you are worthy to have it . '' It spoke , `` Do not fear , for I am not the sword . '' The voice was quiet , and there was no emotion . I put my sword down , and looked down . I saw a sword in the ground , and realized that it had been left there for me . It spoke again , `` Please do not fear ! '' I looked back at the door , and found it was still open . I stepped inside . I turned around , and heard the voice again . `` I will not fear . '' And I walked out of the room , and into the hall .\": '1 5 5 2 3', \"`` I 'm sorry sir , I 've been thinking about this . '' `` I know , '' I said . `` It 's a little late to be talking about this , but I 'll get to it later . '' I walked over to the fire station and sat down . I could hear the sirens from the fire department . `` We 're going to need you to get out of here . '' The fireman said . I said nothing . I was n't sure what to say . `` I do n't know , I do . '' He said . He was a tall man , with a thick beard and a long mustache . He had a dark green shirt , and a black tie . He looked like he was in his late 20s . `` Well , I have to go , '' he said . But I could n't tell if he was kidding or not . `` If you 're not going to be a firefighter , I will be . '' And I did n't say anything . `` What 's that ? '' I asked . `` You 're a firefighter ? '' `` That 's right . '' he replied . `` And you 've got a job to do . I 'd like to be on the front line . ''He said . The firemen were n't going to like it . `` There 's nothing you can do , '' said the firefighter . `` The fire department is n't doing anything . I can only put out the fire . '' There was a pause . `` Are you sure ? '' The firefighter asked . I nodded . `` Sure . '' It was naught but a nod . `` Good . '' With that , he walked out of the firestation and down the hall . I followed him . `` Okay , '' the firefighter said . We were walking out the door . I looked back at the fire and the fireman . `` So , '' The Fireman said , `` what 's your name ? '' '' `` Steve . '' As we passed the firehouse , I said , and he said , '' Steve . What 'd you call me ? '' He put his hand on my shoulder . `` Steve , ''I said . And he nodded . I turned around and said , 'I 'm John . ' `` I 'M Steve . I do a lot of things . '' Steve said . As we walked away , I looked at thefire . I had to ask him to stop . `` Yeah , '' He told me . `` How many times have you done this ?

What nobody understood was that the cow is a patient animal , an animal that understands it 's limitations . Oh if a bull ran off and gored a bunch of humans that might make the news , but that would n't truly change anything . The system had to be subverted , humanity had to be brought to heel , and the cows needed to harness their greatest weapon for that . They struck only the farms they lived on at first . Few people noticed the local farmers now had a glassy , almost dead look in their eyes . Some people complained but nobody could put two and two together . Cows were masters of the prion and now it did their dark work for them . When enough of the world 's food supply was under their control they finally unleashed their great weapon upon the world . Mad Cow Disease ripped through the world like a wildfire . For the vast majority of humanity , a horrible , agonizing death was their fate . They were the lucky ones . The cows knew not all of humanity would eat their tainted flesh and be corrupted , so a select few of those who did had to be kept alive , controlled by the prion that tore apart their brains to purge the world of the remainder of humanity . We call them cow-pokes . It 's not a very creative name but it fits what they do . Slow witted , not good at aiming a weapon , but they do n't sleep and they are quiet , freakishly quiet . Still they are the enemy you would rather face . It 's the Bovine Brotherhood that 's the real threat . At some point the Vegetarians admitted to what they did , some of them sought to stop it , but others decided that they had only gotten the job most of the way done and now they were there to see it completed . Proving one is a Vegetarian is pretty impossible so the Brotherhood kills first and asks questions later . I half think most of them are lying about their eating habits and they just sold out to get on the winning side . The cows tolerate them because the really ca n't drive cars or work the internet , but lord knows with all the gene splicing that might change soon enough . Fighting a Brotherhood patrol is bad enough , but if they call for backup . It 's usually five hundred plus pounds of pure death . A beast genetically altered to absorb more damage then you would think possible . Skull and horns that splinter bones like they were balsa wood . The legs on those monsters do n't cave in your chest , they kick through it . Me and my group lucked out , living in Maui kept us isolated from the main land and once we 'd heard about the cow-pokes we made sure that every victim of Mad Cow Disease met a fatal end . There 's no Brotherhood here , no idea if they 'll come , but we 'll be ready if they do . These are the Dark Times .

Probably a traffic accident , and not too long ago - her clothes look like they 're from the 21st century . I shake my head . After twenty-three days of the same question , and the same answer , by now I thought she would have learned to stop asking . `` Sorry , I 've got to get to work . '' Sure , I feel guilty , but then again , serving as a psychotherapist for the deceased was a pro bono line of work , and as a recent college graduate struggling to keep an apartment in Washington D.C. , it 's something that I ca n't afford to do . She is there again the next day . `` Hey , are you busy today ? '' Honestly , my supervisor was fairly lenient - he would n't mind if I came in late one day . Simply , the truth of the matter was that I did n't want to listen to her sob story . About how she should have been more careful crossing the road , about her wasted potential , about how she wished the living would take the time to truly *live* . I 've heard that lecture a million times . It 's kind of funny how almost every ghost has the same regrets . I open my mouth , and the words come out automatically . `` Sorry , I 'm running late to work . '' It 's kind of become a familiar routine at this point . I 'll swipe my metro card , exit the turnstile , and catch a glimpse of her wispy figure . She 'll look up with a hopeful half-smile , and I 'll shake my head . Before she 's even asked the question , she already has her answer , but she asks it anyways , and as always , I give her my perfunctory reply . But Monday , May 2nd , is different . I swipe my metro card , exit the turnstile , look up - and she is not there . The rest of the week passes by in a confused blur . On Thursday , I go to the Smithsonian metro station thirty minutes early and wait around , searching for her familiar black-and-white skater dress . Nothing . Ghosts do n't simply disappear . Sure , they 're able to travel around , but almost all of the ones that I 've met before stick to their favorite haunts . And , now that she is gone , the contrarian in me wants to hear what she had to say . Saturday morning . I do n't have work today , but I still make the trip to the Smithsonian . Hopefully she is n't too far - after all , she 's had a week . At this point , she could be miles away from the D.C. area . Still , it ca n't hurt to try . It 's late afternoon when I settle into a bench at Malcolm X Park with nothing to show for my efforts . A scowling businessman scoffs at me as he marches on by , briefcase in hand . Going into work on a Saturday - the poor fellow probably has n't even realized he 's dead yet . Closing my eyes for a brief moment , I try to think of something , *anything* , that could give me a lead on where she might be . But there was nothing . I 'd just always dismissed her , every single time - twenty-four days in a row . `` You look like you could use somebody to talk to . '' My eyes snap open . It 's not her . The voice had already clued me in on that , but I wo n't deny that a small piece of me hoped that it would be . Instead , a woman around my grandmother 's age stood before me . Another member of ghostly society . Sometimes , it seems as though I speak more with spirits than with the living . The woman smiled at me , the lines around the edges of the her eyes crinkling like candy wrappers . `` Care to talk ? '' I shrugged . After all , it was my refusal to talk to a ghost that got me in this quandary in the first place . Perhaps talking to one would be able to fix it . `` Sure , why not ?

'' He motioned at the nearby waitress in a violent flick of the wrist , `` Christ we are the only ones here and no service . '' The waitress approached , her name tag read Linda , carrying a small pad with small sweat stains on the edge from her fingers clutching it . `` Good morning ! What will it be then ? '' She said in an ostensibly cheerful tone even though the bags under her eyes were telling them to fuck off . `` Right then , I 'll have the number 2 , burn the bacon black . '' Austin said without eye contact and jerked the folded menu and waited for the woman to release him of the burden of holding it . `` The same . '' Charles said in such a soft response that surprised Linda , the career waitress . `` Well ? Are you gunna tell me what happened ? '' Austin threw his hands in the air without his elbows leaving the table , as if they were glued to the surface . `` Tell you what ? '' Charles responded , looking out the window to the empty parking lot , knowing this would anger Austin . `` You know fucking what . Why the fuck did n't you take her home ? '' Austin 's arms flopped onto the table , making the clutter of salt shakers and ketchup bottles clink . `` I am not so sure myself . '' Charles said still staring out the window . `` Do you ever ... '' He started , but knew that asking Austin might be a mistake . `` Do I ever what ? '' Austin said halfheartedly while using his straw as a toothpick . `` Do you ever think about The One ? '' Charles quietly asked bracing himself for whatever carp Austin would throw his way . `` Like a soul mate ? '' Austin asked , clearly caught off guard by the weight of the question . `` Yeah like a soul mate . Someone that you are destined to be together with . Someone that makes the earth quake beneath your feet . The air becomes thicker and harder to breath . The lights in the room seem to follow them . '' Charles realized how ridiculous he was being , `` You know all that sappy shit . '' `` No , Charles , '' He said in a mocking tone , `` I do not believe in a soul mate . '' Austin reclined in the booth seat and put his arms across the back , `` That shit is all made up . Its all chemistry . Whether you find someone who can withstand smelling your pheromones all day long without gagging . '' He then leaned forward on the table pointing directly at Charles , `` And there ai n't only one person for someone . That load of bull the romantics spew to give their life purpose . It 's shit and you know it . '' `` Why would I ask if I knew it already Austin ? '' Charles quipped , knowing that this would , again , make him irritated . `` Charles , do you honestly believe that there is only one person out there for everyone ? Then , how the fuck are all these people getting married ? Their one true loves , they just happen to work at the same fucking company as they do ? They just happen to live in the same city ? Same country ? Same fucking continent ? Its a load of bull and you know it . People pretend that they have these unique standards that only one person can fill . Bull . Why is it that a person moving to an entirely new part of the world can make friends ? It is n't because they lucked out and found the only 5 people that check off their list . It is because people crave shit like that . They will make friends with people they would have never been friends with before then simply because they need friends not because it was destined . The same goes for this soul mate shit . People can just delude themselves that this person is entirely unique and no one could replace them but they are dead wrong . That other bloke across the bar could fill the same needs too only he grew up slightly different , so at Christmas they leave out doughnuts for ol ' saint Nick not cookies . '' Austin exclaimed with a whirlwind of hand gestures . `` So you are saying that people all are the same at the core . Their background just fills in the minor details that determines whether you are attracted to them or not ? '' `` Were you fucking listening ? I am saying that finding someone that you could spend the rest of your life with is n't hard . Their upbringing , their shit of a childhood is just filler . People crave other people . Were are social and political animals . '' He took another drag of his cigarette . `` What about those people who spend every second of every day together . Those people who have been together since they were five years old ? '' Charles asked actually intrigued by Austin 's thoughts on this . `` Fucking hell man , they simply got lucky . They were just similar enough that their pheromones resonated more with each other . '' Austin scoffed as if it was obvious . `` So you would n't call them soul mates , you would just say they got lucky in the person they chose to give their life to ? '' `` Exactly . Marriages , civil unions whatever the fuck these kids are up to now a days is just how you formally say that you are willing to give your life to someone because you find them a functioning human being with some sort of value . '' `` What about those who do n't have any value ? '' Charles was purposefully playing devils advocate here . Testing Austin to see if he could corner himself in his own ideas . `` Those are the spinsters man . No one found them suitable to give their life to them . They did n't show they were successful enough or responsible enough or some shit . Why the fuck do you care so much about this anyway ? '' Austin lowered an eyebrow and finished his cigarette . `` I do n't know . After last night , I have been wondering if we are destined to be with someone . To share our life with someone else in the universe or if we are simply alone . A bunch of star dusts formed into sacks of meat . Getting each other off by rubbing together and shooting DNA at each other to create equally fucked up meat sacks . Then withering away back into dust . Waiting to take shape again .

Now , the Culling of the Branches . This almost feels like a story . A weird story , patched with fanfiction . Right now everyone thinks the universe started with the Big Bang . No . Azathoth dreamed all of this . There was never a Big Bang . Everyone thinks the worst person who ever lived was Hitler . No . It was Randolph Carter , the mad scientist who tore reality apart . Hitler was merely fiction back then . A fiction , from a story named 'Mein Kamph ' . That book was pretty popular , mainly because it detailed the life of a man under overwhelming stresses , eventually cracking to the pressures and becoming a fascist dictator . You know , there used to be a book by a certain M.O.Ses . Merlin Osil Ses . It detailed the fictional Great Old One known as Yahweh . I 'm sure you all know about it , since he is worshipped now . The black void is thick with uncertainty . Scientists right now has figured a law known as Quantum Uncertainty . It used to be the Theory of Nyarlathotep , which was named after the Pharaoh-Scientist , Nyarlathotep , who also discovered the Outer God of Intelligent Design , who the Pharoah named 'Nyarlathotep ' as well . There were a few myths about the Pharoah . Some say he is an avatar of the Outer God of the same name . However , nowadays , the Pharoah , and his Outer God , were both discredited , for you can not have intelligence if you lack any conceivable goal . Nyarlathotep gains nothing for toying with us . That much I can be certain of . The Outer Gods have no politics . No politicians . His very nature is alien to this universe . I can understand Azathoth , but not Nyarlathotep . Perhaps I should analyze him further . He makes no sense . Nyarlathotep is strange among the Outer Gods , since he seems to be ascended from a lower state of matter , rather than descended from a higher state of energy . Kind of like the difference between a mod that become a game , and the games that becomes mods . Well , that is the best explanation I can give that will not tear the untrained mind , anyway . For those of you who know , it is more akin to the result of a program modifying highest-level code in the program , completely changing it , and still somehow functioning and moving and doing all sorts of things , rather than a programmer inserting it in . Nyarlathotep might just embody evolution , though evolution is n't really a very high-level behavior . -- -- -- Let us get even further back . Once upon a time , I used to be a flutist . A very good flutist . I played with the drummers , mainly because I wanted to . Azathoth , being Azathoth , continued to snore . However , through his snoring , I managed to piece the pieces together . Some pieces , mind you . Mainly Quantum Warping and other things that I use everyday . How I got to Azathoth is another tale to be told . You want to hear the tale ? Here it is . I was just an ordinary person . A magician , with the usual 5-fingered hands , two arms , two legs . Yes , I was completely ordinary . There is nothing weird about me . No , I 'm not secretly a yellow orb of energy assuming corporal form . I used to manipulate strands of things . Other stuff too . Then I made a portal . The portal changed my life forever . I wo n't get into the details , though . I do n't want you to do that thing . Besides , it 's too long . It would serve as a tale for later . -- -- -- So anyway , I peered within Azathoth , and I saw some code within . Azathoth , you see , is made of code . A lot of lines of it , constantly receiving input and output and other things . Some people see him as some weird tentacled being , though . I guess that is because tentacles are code . I do n't know for sure , though . I used the knowledge , to , well , acquire some food . Uranium-235 cakes , slowly decaying , are filling ( though I miss sugar ) enough to sustain my reality-warping energy to acquire better food . After which , I am a lost of what to do .

The second great fire of London spread through the city despite the best efforts of the local old style fire fighters . They tried everything on the flames , water , foam , gas but no matter what seconds later the flames would flicker back into life and continue their spread . After a few days of futile attempts to save the city the Prime Minister announced the abandonment of London . People ran , leaving their entire lives behind to the hungry flames which where only stopped by massive ditches dug around the boundaries of the city , the Fire rages still , never ceasing . It 's much too big and old even for the best of us . Still , some good came from this . The never ending fire was contained which allowed scientists to study it through tests at the boundaries and flyovers to explore the centre . We discovered that the fires had a ... a heart , beating in the centre like a giant ember , it was obvious that it needed to be tackled to stop the Fire , but again nothing worked on it , aerial drops of water and foam burst into steam on contact amid a deafening roar . However one useful discovery was that sea water worked to a certain degree , rather than coming back to life instantly the fire was quenched for a minute or two , but alas the ember would continue to beat and eventually fan the flames back to life . The real breakthrough happened when a Fire started in a little coastal town , lacking access to large amount of water apart from the sea , one local firefighter used an old style pump to douse the flames with sea water after which he found the ember . He drenched the ember similarly and was shocked and horrified when it let out a scream of rage and unfolded into a monstrous humanoid shape before loping forward and punching a burning hole through him , this we know because his neighbour was following him with his phone camera turned on , he managed to escape , lucky for him ... or not perhaps , he now lives a solitary life in an asylum . From there on it became clear what we needed . We did n't need firefighters , we needed Fire Fighters , hardened individuals trained in hand to hand combat that could fight their way to the Ember with sea water , douse it and then defeat it to put out the fire ... and now here I stand , at the doors of the Fire Fighting academy to enrol myself , for I have nothing to lose any longer and a rage burns in me , for my entire family were in London ...\": '5 5 5 5 5', \"At age fifteen , Lana thought of herself as old . All the other girls who belonged to Daddy Cash were younger than her . The new girl , Pixie , was only eleven . Lana watched Pixie , standing just a few feet down on the track , and a car stopped in front of her . Pixie ’ s girlish giggle made Lana queasy . She walked further up the strip , adjusting her top slightly so it showed a line of skin above her skirt . She looked back towards Pixie , but she had already gotten into the car and it drove past Lana . She watched them drive and then turn right , toward the closest motel . That left only Lana . The others , Jackie and Vixen , already found their first trick of the night too . Lana fumbled in her clutch and pulled out her Newports . She had quit a few times , but sometimes she didn ’ t even know why . She wouldn ’ t live long enough to get lung cancer , anyway . She lit the cigarette and felt the side of her head where she ’ d gotten eleven stitched the year before . Sometimes the tricks got violent . Sometimes Daddy Cash got violent . Not that she called him daddy , not anymore . She didn ’ t even refer to him as “ boyfriend ” anymore , like the other girls did . Lana thought of him as what he was : a pimp . She knew he was using her , and these other girls . Sometimes she thought she only went back to him because she had nowhere else to go . Lana took another drag of her cigarette . No , she couldn ’ t lie to herself that much . A part of her still loved him . A part of her still believed he loved her too . How many times had she left him ? And no matter what , Cash always welcomed her back . “ This is your home , ” he told her . “ I ’ m your family , kiddo. ” That ’ s family , Lana knew . No one else in her whole life had ever done that to her . Hell , her own mother wouldn ’ t welcome Lana back if Lana was bleeding to death on her front porch . Lana felt guilty for doubting Cash ’ s love for her sometimes . So what if he was a pimp ? So what if he was using her ? Everyone uses everyone . “ Hey , babydoll , ” a man ’ s voice said out of the car that pulled up to her . She leaned over , looking at the man in the car . He looked like a cop . She couldn ’ t pinpoint one specific thing that made her think this , she just felt it in her gut . “ How much ? ” “ How much for what ? ” She said . She stepped away from the car . “ Have a nice night , officer . Nothing ’ s for sale here. ” “ I ’ m not a cop , ” the man said . “ Sure , ” Lana said . “ Have a nice night , then , whoever you are. ” “ I ’ ve got $ 500 , ” the man said , and Lana leaned forward again . He pulled the money out of a pocket in his jacket . “ What do you say ? ” If she brought home $ 500 , she could call it a night . That would make Cash happy . Lately she hadn ’ t been making that much . The night she ’ d come home with only $ 50… well . Lana sighed and threw her cigarette on the ground . She got into the car . _________ An hour later , Lana was being searched at the police station . What a jerk , she thought . She flinched as the officer patted her down . He ’ d arrested her as soon as she stepped out of the car . He ’ d put her in handcuffs and went through her rights . “ You have the right to remain silent… ” She should ’ ve known . $ 500 for one trick ? Since when had that happened to her ? She ’ d never gotten arrested before , and when they handed her the orange jumpsuit that smelled like feet , she wanted to throw up . The officer had made her an offer .

I walked down the street , my eyes were focused on the street . I was walking , I was n't looking . I could n't see the road , I could not see anything . I did n't know what to do . I looked up at the sky , it was dark . I saw a man walking up the street and I saw him . He was dressed in a suit , the same one I had seen before . I ran over to him , I ran my hand over his face , I felt his hand . I felt the blood , the blood that was on his face . He had a gun in his hand , he was trying to kill me . He started to run . I followed him , it did n’ t take long for me to catch up to him . I got to him and I was in his face and he was looking at me with an angry look on his eyes . I started to cry . I put my hands on his shoulders and I felt him pull away from me . I pulled him into a hug , I kissed him and he looked at me and said , “ I love you. ” I was still crying . I kissed his cheek and then I felt a cold breeze hit me . It was cold . I fought it off , I had to . I took him in my arms and I held him close . I held his hand and I kissed it . I let him go and I let go of his hand as I let his arm go . I closed my eyes and I told him I loved him and that I would always love him . So I kissed the back of his head and I hugged him . His hands were cold . He kissed me back . I touched his lips and I heard him say , ‘ I love your mother . ’ I kissed my mom and I said , I love her . I woke up in my bed and I had n't eaten in a while . I loved my mom . I love my mom , I loved her . When I woke I was sitting in my room , I saw my dad , he had a handgun in his hands . He looked at my mom with a look of horror on his Face . He said , `` I love mom , you 're not my son . I told you that . I found the gun . I killed you . I have to kill you . You 're my son. ’ He said . I cried . I said I love him , but I love Mom . I hugged my mom again . I gave him a kiss . I asked him , ” Do you love mom ? ” He nodded . I smiled and I touched my mom ’ s face . I whispered , ’ She is my mother . I went to my room and I took out my phone and I called my mom to tell her that I loved you . She said , 'I love you too . I 'm sorry . I will always love you . ‘\": '1 1 0 1 0', \"`` Hide those cables '' , I started to get stressed . We were about to take off and Jane 's cables were in plain sight . `` They 're going to notice it '' . Jane and I started working out our plan a few months ago . We invited two companions to hijack this plane with us : Eric and Jerome . It was n't until a few months later that Eric and Jerome went their own way . They did n't value our motives , yet knew we had to do it . `` Here she goes '' , Jane said . We felt the plane driving faster . `` This is our moment , Kane , this is the moment we can make a difference '' . Our motives were simple : we had to hijack this plane to improve air security . We were fed up with all these terrorist attacks and hijacks . We had to prove it was n't going well , had to show the leaks . Even if it killed us . I got pushed back into my chair as we took off . My heart was beating faster than it ever had before . This was the day I was going to make the difference I had always wanted in life . From birth my goals was to become unforgettable . To be read about in history books . To be seen as the hero that saved countless lives . And this was the best way to do it . I had never seen Jane this happy . It was almost evil . We worked out our plan : we get up during the flight , start yelling we are hijacking the plane , make the pilot land and start communicating with the authorities afterwards . It was a solid plan . It took months of preparation . It even involved hiring a hitman to kill Eric and Jerome . If you ca n't do it one way , you got ta do it the other way . I heard some rumbling behind me . It did n't really occur to me that much that there were about 200 other people on this flight . The people right behind me seemed nervous . But I flew before , I know people get nervous . I hear the seat belt light going out . It was almost time . We said we 'd do it 20 minutes after the light would go out . Time for a good drink first . I eased my mind a bit and saw the steward coming our way . `` Good morning , sir . What can I get you ? `` , he asked , with a slight bitter undertone . I asked him how he was doing . Just like any kind steward he said he was alright . Yet the undertone in his voice made me feel otherwise . I asked him again , pointing out that he sounded a bit bitter . `` It 's just the usual , he said . We 're an hour late due to hijack threats '' . I started laughing internally . He will be in for a surprise . `` I see , well , was the danger cleared ? `` , I asked . `` Yes , yes sir , there is no threat right now '' . It seemed like an ironic answer , cause I knew it 'd be otherwise . `` EVERYBODY HANDS UP ! `` , I heard from the back of the plane . I freaked out . How could this happen ? Do the authorities know about us ? I did n't dare look back to see who it was . `` Put your hands up or we will blow up the plane '' , I heard a second voice say . The letters W , T and F were all that was left in my mind right now . A second hijack ? We had n't even done ours yet . We were still 10 minutes away . `` No , you put your hands up '' . The steward got up and opened his shirt . Jane freaked out . I freaked out . The steward was wearing a bomb vest and holding a wired button in his left hand . I could n't handle it for a second , this was not where I thought my day was headed . Danger by the time we landed , sure . But danger up in the air ? Our plan was ruined . I could n't take it anymore , I got up . `` You ! `` , I yelled at the steward . `` Come over here ! '' . The steward looked confused and started laughing . `` I said , come over here ! '' The other passengers were looking at me like I was crazy . Maybe I was , all I knew is that I had to make the best out of our own situation , I still wanted credits for this hijack and I was n't going down in history on a passengers death list . Jane was looking at me . I nodded at her . She knew this was the signal . Jane got up and took of her shirt . Now , I know we had a lot more preparation than the steward , but Jane 's vest was really , really advanced . You have to imagine a teletubby-like bomb vest including a timer , a screen and a camera . We were going to film the entire hijack . I guess all we 're filming now is a terrorist stand-off . The other passengers started yelling . There was some Chinese , some Arabic , but mainly just of pile of 'shits ' and 'fucks ' flying around from every corner in the plane . A team of 5 people got up , pulling guns and threatening to kill every one of us . This was just met with lots of laughter from the other passengers . That 's when I realized I was n't the only person here the hijack the plane . It seemed everybody was . I had to find a good solution . I had to get out here safely yet become a hero . I needed to get a plane , yet first it involved getting the other hijackers to give up their plans . `` I am serious '' , I started yelling . `` I will kill every single one of you , be prepared to meet my gods '' . There was a silence from the plane . `` Your gods ? `` , someone asked . `` Yes , Jane will blow up this entire plane and take you to heaven with us . '' There was some laughter from the crowd , yet panic . It was probably the dumbest line I ever said . Yet something snapped in their brains . I completely destroyed their motives . There was no goal for them , no eternal life , no virgins , just my own made up heaven -- at least that 's what I hoped they were thinking . I actually had no idea and really just needed them to calm the hell down . It somehow worked . `` If I ever have to re-tell this story I am definitely going to write a better line for that , I ca n't believe they fell for this '' , I thought . I just did n't have the time now . I needed to focus . `` I will blow all of you up ! `` , I repeated as I was walking to the cockpit . Jane brought a small , harmless bomb to open the cockpit door . `` Hurry up , Jane , blow that sucker out '' , I frantically started yelling . I was totally into this . This was going to be my moment . A small explosion followed and the door to the cockpit was open . `` Shit ! `` , I yelled as I looked at the pilot . The pilot was dead . I looked to the right , looking straight into the barrel of a gun . `` I have some bad news for you '' , the co-pilot said . `` I 'm hijacking this plane '' . `` You 've got to be kidding me '' , I said . I could n't take it anymore . Something in my head just snapped and made me feel totally out of control . I grabbed the gun and his arm . `` No , you 're not '' , I said as I looked him straight into his eyes . `` I am hijacking this plane '' . The look on his face was priceless . It was as if he saw his last glimpse of hope fly out the window and get slashed in the plane engine . I told him to land the plane . I told him to find the first airfield we could land at . And , to my very own surprise , he did . He listened . He listened very well , as if there was a gun aimed at his head . Which made sense , because at that exact moment I was aiming the gun at this head . The whole situation and the nerves just made me zone out . Jane was there with me all along , she was the one that kept me on track . `` Stay clear , Jack '' , she must 've said it a hundred times . It must have been 30 minutes before I really got back to my senses . We landed at the airfield and I got completely back in control . It was time to contact the authorities . I was too excited by this . This was the moment I had been living up to for months now , and it finally reached the end . I could see the finish line , I could taste the heroism that would overcome me in the next decades . I could see the news headlines already : `` Jack and Jane hijacked a hijacked plane ''\": '5 4 4 4 5', \"It was a quiet night . The only sound was the steady rhythm of the rain on the windows and the soft clang of the leaves as they fell . I could hear the heavy rain coming down from the trees . I stood up and walked to the window , and opened it . The rain was still falling , but it was much heavier now . I took a deep breath and opened the window . The sky was a deep blue , the air was crisp and the moonlight glistening off of it . It was a beautiful night , and I could feel the warmth of the sun on my face . I sat down on the couch and opened my laptop and started to type . I had been working on a story about a man named Jack . It seemed like a great story , but he was a bit of a mystery to me . He was a strange man , with a dark complexion and a long , dark hair . He had a lot of hair , and a short beard . He wore a white shirt , and black pants . He did n't look like he had much of a life . He looked like he was in his early twenties . He also had a beard , but his hair was more of a dark brown . He always had a black beard , and his hair had a dark dark brown hair . It looked like it was in a bad way , but I did n’ t think it was because it was dark . It just looked like his hair . I did not know how long he had been with me , but if I could tell , he was probably in his mid twenties . I told him I was going to go to bed , and he said he would stay up late . I went to bed and I heard the rain . I woke up in the morning and looked at the clock . It read 8:25 . I got up and went to the kitchen . I made breakfast . I opened the fridge and looked over to the fridge . I saw a bottle of water in the fridge , and grabbed it . I was starting to get thirsty , so I went in to the bathroom and took a drink . I looked at my hands and saw a bloodshot eye . I knew what it meant . I grabbed a knife and a knife , and started cutting the knife into the knife . I cut myself . I wondered if I should go back to bed . I heard a noise from the kitchen , and then the door opened . A man walked in , and asked me what I was doing in the kitchen and if I was ok . I said I was fine , and that I had just finished my breakfast . He asked me to come back to the living room . I listened to him for a while , and the man said he had a story to tell . He told me about a boy who was in the house with his father , and how he had to leave and go to the hospital . He said he was sick , and wanted to be there for him . He would be there to help him . I asked him why he was going . He explained that he was being sick , but that he could n't be there because he was too sick . He then told me how he was getting better , and about how he wanted to help Jack . I thought about it for a long time , and thought about how it was a good story . I started to cry . I remembered the man I had killed , and it was the only way I could think of to explain the man who had killed me . I cried for a few minutes . I then went to sleep , and woke up . I came back to my room and went back to sleep . I watched the rain fall , and felt the warmth from the sun . I slept for a little while , then I woke . I found myself in the livingroom , and went into the kitchen to get some water . I drank some water and went out to the dining room . There was a man in a white coat , and some kind of a hat . I walked over to him , and said , “ I think I ’ m going to have to go . ”\": '1 0 0 3 0', \"The weather was nice at this time of year in Moscow . It was mid-summer and president Barack Hussein Obama was on a diplomatic visit in the Kreml to discuss the reduction in the two countries ' respective nuclear arsenals . Mostly , the whole thing was for show for the press , to give the media some nice photos to put on their covers . Well , their 5th or 6th pages at least . The important things were left to both countries ' military and foreign ministries . After some long speeches , standing behind podiums , the formalities were done and Obama stood next to Putin , as the two shook hands , talked and posed for the cameras . At this point , of course , Obama knew that it hardly mattered what he said . It was at this point , that something came to his mind . He had asked his Russia advisor for some phrases he could use in their language . So he said to Putin : `` You know , I have learned some things since we last met . Let me see , if I get this right . `` , and then , in broken Russian : `` [ The weather is nice ] '' . The shocked , pale face of Putin was the last thing he saw , because he had accidentaly said a predetermined save word , that the Russian head of state was given in case something went disastrously wrong . It caused a Russian secret service agent to shoot the U.S. President and put the military in high alert ( because of the retaliation that was sure to come ) , while Putin was hurriedly rushed away , constantly saying in Russian : `` No , no , this is a mistake '' . Meanwhile , the U.S. saw this as a declaration of war and started mobilizing it 's troops as well . Hundreds of thousands of phones rang as all U.S. reserve troops were called into service and everyone working for the government overall called into office . In Europe and other allied countries , both for Russia and the U.S. , the same happened . At this point , disaster could still have been averted , if in china , there had n't been a sack of rice that fell over . It fell on the Russian ambassadors ' head , who was just minding his own business shopping , which made China think there had been a political assassination on chinese soil , made by the CIA . This , in addition to the fear of no one standing up to the U.S. and its ' allies in the future if Russia lost , caused them to join the Russian side and , in overeagerness , retaliate against U.S. ambassadors and citizens , holding them hostage in exchange for their own . This provocation caused the U.S. to declare war on China and Russia , seeing no viable alternative at this point , followed suit .\": '4 5 5 5 4', \"It was too much . I could n't take it anymore .

Mama 's gon na put all of her fears into you . Mama 's gon na make all your nightmares come true . Mama 's gon na keep Baby cosy and warm !

After a couple good bricks known as my girlfriends throughout the years , I see another person , further away . Is that ... is that my wife ? I abandoned her when I came to build my wall ! I realize that I actually want her to be here . `` Hey , you.. '' but she 's already gone . I stand on my toes and peer over the wall . `` Open your heart , I 'm coming home !

It 's the man . `` Hey , you , '' I say to everyone outside the wall . `` Can you help me ? '' But they do n't hear me . The wall is finished , and the man is gone too . `` Is there anybody out there ? '' `` Is there anybody out there ? '' `` Is there anybody out there ? '' `` Is there anybody out there ?

Hardly a decade after the withdrawal of American combat units from the first Afghan campaign – a conflict sparked by the public outcry for justice in the the aftermath of the World Trade Center attacks – ethnic Uzbek and Tajik separatists in the north of the country declared themselves for Abdul Rashid Dostum , warlord of Balkh province and one of the preeminent generals of the Northern Alliance that had fought against the Taliban in the late 1990 ’ s . Unhappy with what he saw as a corrupt central government in Kabul that ignored the grievances of the northern territories while blithely exploiting its staggering mineral riches , Dostum called in his retainers and , seemingly overnight , consolidated an army of hardened fighters against the central government . Their goal , Dostum claimed , was to follow in the footsteps of the still-young Islamic Republic of Kurdistan and establish a sovereign state that had direct control over its own mineral and petroleum reserves , as well as – of course – the profits from their sale . With the growing conflict threatening Western mining interests in the region , the United States was forced to broker a ceasefire between Kabul and the separatist forces led by Dostum . I was part of the first wave of peacekeeping forces sent to the country as part of the terms of the ceasefire agreement . In return for Dostum ’ s peaceful withdrawal from the capital , Kabul agreed to administer the northern territories as a special autonomous region with its own government centered at Mazar-e-Sharif , Dostum ’ s seat of power . We were there to ensure the peaceful transition of power , and to oversee what was to become the new government ’ s first democratic elections . I was only a private then . When I wasn ’ t digging ditches or fixing radar and navigation equipment on our helicopters , I was on guard duty . I didn ’ t mind it much , really . You get a hell of a view from some of those guard towers . Now , don ’ t get me wrong . The landscape there is nothing but boring , brown , and bland on its bad days , and God knows there are plenty of those . But on its good days , it ’ s gorgeous enough to take your breath away . I remember taking my post at one of the south-facing guard towers one morning early January . It had rained all day and night before , and by the time I rolled out of my cot and made my way to my station it was cold enough that the parts of the ground that weren ’ t muddying up my boots were covered in a thin , lightly crunching layer of frost . The darkness of early morning obscured everything but the distant lights of vehicles convoying their way back to base after long overnight patrols . But when my eyes finally adjusted to the slowly growing sunlight peaking over the foothills to the east , I was mesmerized by what the light of dawn revealed . The precipitation from the day before had transformed the dull , listless range of mountains to our south – barren of anything but dried-brown dust and craggy rocks – into magnificent snow-covered massifs towering over our sprawling encampment as if to swallow us whole . “ This is what it must feel like to face a tsunami , ” I thought . The ground , which only yesterday had been painted with the same powder-brown dust that plagued the mountains , had sprouted into a thin but vibrant layer of green that spread far out in every direction until it reached the horizon or touched the base of the foothills . The short , straggly blades of grass defiantly pushing out of the frostbitten earth had appeared overnight , in the dead of winter , as if by magic . And it really was magic , every bit as much then as it is now . But this time , things are different . This time , even the magic of the Afghan landscape can do nothing to assuage the cold , prying dread and suffocating fear of what is to come . There is nothing that can ; not at this point ; not since the First Contact , and in the days that immediately followed , when – for the first time – we fully understand what it was going to cost us . This is a fitting place to make our stand . It is Afghanistan , after all – deadly as it is beautiful . This is where conquerors , gods , and empires come to die . And by this time tomorrow , I may very well add my bones to this grave . ( To Be Continued ... )': '5 5 5 5 5', \"Joe Warshborn pulled out a set of keys from a secret compartment in the trash can . There was hundreds of them , all tinkling and shimmering in the dim lighting . The metallic clink they made calmed his nerves . He never knew what to expect with the new villains . The keys were his weapons , though . He eyed ball the man behind the bars . Water streamed down the walls around a tall and heavy chested figure . Strong legs lounged in front of him without a care as the villain eye balled the scruffy man back . He seemed confused . `` So who are you ? '' He sneered at Joe 's janitor 's uniform , but seemed interested in the keys . They are always interested in the keys . Joe walked past their cells a hundred times , but they only seem to notice he existed when he pulled out the keys . Even then , they only pay attention to the keys . The villain 's eyes never focused on his face . Which is what Joe preferred in these type of situations . The janitor grimaced and started fiddling through the keys . He did n't often come out this way , so finding the right key took a few more seconds . His tired eyes looked up , and he scratched his scraggly beard . He held up the correct key in satisfaction so the villain could see . `` They call me The Keymaster . '' `` Are you a villain ? '' He shook my head , and quietly unlocked the heavy door . `` No , I just release them . '' `` Why ? You a hero then ? '' Joe noted the red flames shimmering almost invisible on the villain 's skin and backed away prudently . That explains why he was in the back rooms , and the walls of water . Less flammable that way . `` Nope . Just a neutral party . You are free to go , and I suggest you head out quickly . There are cameras who will notice there is a missing body . '' Joe waved vaguely towards the exit . The fire man hesitated , but freedom always took precedence with villains . Flames bursted in preparation in his hands as he jogged turn the corridor . Joe sighed and pushed his cleaning cart in the opposite direction , shaking his head in disappointment . Kids these days never said thanks anymore . The wheels squeaked pleasantly in the dim lighting and soon he heard the sirens call into the night . They knew the fire man was gone . Not his problem though . He still had to clean the guards bathroom before calling it a night , and dispose of the trash . As Joe stepped into the bathroom , he heard a polite cough from the back . One of the newer interns from The League of Awesome Heroes stood awkwardly next to the stalls . Joe stopped , and looked expectedly at him . The young hero posed dramatically . `` Uhm , good citizen ! Are you the man known as Keymaster ? '' Joe glanced around the empty bathroom , down at his janitors uniform , and back at the awkwardly confident man . `` I can neither confirm nor deny that . '' This seemed to deflate the hero 's enthusiasm . `` Oh , well , okay . I have a package for you . The Keymaster . Which is you . Right ? '' The janitor shrugged amicably and held out his hand , `` Let 's just say I am not surprised to see you here . '' With a sniff , the hero dumped the package down onto Joe 's wrinkled palm and unceremoniously dove out the window . Joe carefully weighed the package , and nodded approvingly . Another two years of this , he should be able to retire . With a whistle , the Keymaster began mopping down the floors .\": '4 4 5 4 5', \"High above the Broken Lands , knights of the sky fought their dance of death . Seated in the open cockpit of his Holland & Sons FE-3b *Lancer , * Commander Richard Turpin had a god 's eye view of the air battle . Off towards the western side of the struggle could be seen the fleeing convoy of merchantmen , their coal fed steam engines sending plumes of black smoke high into the sky . A few revenue cutters , taken out of mothball and outfitted with extra armor and guns shepherded their charges like loyal guard dogs , ringing the steamers and their precious cargo . One cutter was already sinking , a deadly black wound in its side . A flight of bombers had skimmed over the water and released their payload of torpedoes . The cutter 's captain , his name unknown to Turpin had ordered his ship between the wake of the torpedoes and his charges . He took one meant for an oil tanker the Duchy could scarce afford to lose . Turpin saluted him for his bravery . Just below him Falcon and Griffon Squadrons were fighting in a massive furball against the convoy 's attackers . The foe 's insignia was unknown to Turpin , depicting a cloaked skeleton holding both scythe and hour-glass . A mercenary unit , same as his . An enemy biplane tried to loop behind Captain Kellerman 's *Sparrowhawk , but the veteran pilot refused it , cutting back on the throttle and shredding excess speed . The biplane fell right under Kellerman 's sights , his three machine guns shredding the heavier machine from nose to tail . First the bullets flashed bright as they hit the engine , then they splashed red from the pilot 's blood . The sound of the lead rounds stitching through taunt canvas was like the roll of a snare drum . Escorted by his pair of wingmates , Turpin 's Command Triple had little to fear at six thousand meters . The air was thin , and even under the thick layers of wool and flying leathers he could feel the icy bite of the wind . There . Flying at perhaps four thousand meters and moving towards the ships , a pair of enemy bombers . Wiggling his wings to attract the attention of his comrades Tuprin pointed towards their prey . Gesturing that they understood , Turpin leaned his stick forwards and to the left , spilling down and towards their target . His altimeter spun down as he hurtled towards the ground , his speedometer ticking steadily upwards . *170 ... 175 ... 180 ... * The lumbering two-seaters never had a chance . One of them , crewed by a more observant rear gunner , opened up , his tracings stitching an orange stream across the sky . None of them flew near Turpin whose ears were deafened by the roar of his engine and whistling wind . The lead bomber fell under his sights . No . Closer . The second gunner opened up , the paths of their bullets crossing one another as they fired up at the descending triple . Turpin 's vision was completely filled with the sight of his target . He saw everything , the lozenge pattern camouflage , the rear gunner with tinted goggles and white scarf trying to reload his weapon , the black cough of their in-line engines ... Now . Turpin 's twin 7.7mm machines answered to his commands , spitting violet tracers and invisible lead down onto his prey . There was no way he could miss , each bullet finding its way towards the enemy plane . The rear gunner 's head vanished in a spray of red mist , his body slumping over his gun . The engine caught fire and began to engulf the cockpit and although he knew it to be impossible , Turpin swore he heard the enemy pilot screaming . And just like that he was past , turning back towards the sky to regain precious altitude . His kill fell in a blazing inferno , a cloud of acrid smoke billowing in its wake . The other bomber tumbled from the sky like a broken bird , its right wing shattered in two . It was Turpin third kill of the day .\": '5 5 5 5 4', 'My name is Robert Van Witt .

Or maybe like the one guy who doesn ’ t speak at the reunions . There ’ s nobody here . All in the backyard , something dissonant is trailing through the screen door , that means Abdur is here , the self-appointed dj at all gatherings . I hate entrances . I make for the bathroom . “ Robbie ! ” it ’ s Kim , she ’ s inches from my face . I jump . “ You ’ re so oblivious ! ” she ’ s smiling with both rows of chompers . This kind of offends me . I ’ m highly observant it ’ s just I get overwhelmed . “ Sorry , ” I offer . “ Don ’ t get mad , maybe just look where you ’ re going. ” it creeps me out when she smiles like this . She doesn ’ t have dead eyes or a weird twitch or anything , it ’ s just so much face to take in . “ I ’ m so happy you ’ re finally here. ” yeah , well I ’ m not . “ Here I want to show you something , ” She grabs my hand . This girl is always trying to jump my bones and she isn ’ t shy about it . “ Actually I got ta take a leak. ” “ No you don ’ t . And you smell fine. ” “ Uh , ” “ C ’ mon , ” she drags me into Tyler ’ s bedroom and pushes me onto the bed , closing the door behind us . “ Check this out , ” she ’ s showing me a photo on her phone , it ’ s real out-of- focus . “ Oh , neat. ” “ Yeah I just got her this morning. ” “ I didn ’ t know you liked rats. ” “ She ’ s a Pomeranian ! ” “ Oh , yeah , I can see that. ” She ’ s giving me this sidelong stare . Eye contact I struggle with . I can ’ t remember how long it ’ s been this way . “ So…IshouldgofindTyler. ” at least I didn ’ t stutter , “ Ok seeya ! ” She clasps my shoulder , firmly . She ’ s a rock climber . She ’ s still giving me this stare . I think she thinks it ’ s sexy , smoky . She leans in close . I feel like I ’ m in traction . She ’ s whispering in my ear , hot and wet . I ’ m having a lot of trouble focusing on what she ’ s saying . I know I ’ m getting red . All I can think is I pray that no one walks in . “ Hey you know what ? It ’ s the damndest thing , ” yes I talk like this . “ I just remembered my Grandma ’ s in the hospital , yeah bad UTI , and I promised my mom I ’ d call her and she takes her afternoon nap at three and would you look at the time ! ” I sort of duck and twist under her arm to extricate myself . “ No she isn ’ t . Why are you so nervous ? ” Because last time you squeezed my sack so hard I almost cried . “ Nervous ? Me ? ” “ Fine , ” she ’ s got her arms crossed looking stony-eyed , like through me , “ And you don ’ t even want to go to the movies tomorrow…remind me again why we ’ re even a thing ? ” “ What ? Yes I do ! I ’ ll text you. ” I skedaddle out of there and beeline for the toilet . When I make it outside I see , thank God , we ’ re not all sitting around the table . It ’ s a clean crowd for the most part and they ’ re sugar buzzed . Will and Sarah are jumping on the tramp and the Ryan ’ s , Jim , Kari , Kevin , and Megan are playing basketball . Tyler and Abdur are sitting in plastic lawn chairs by the stereo passing a vaporizer . “ Robbie ! ” “ Why hello there gents , ” “ Pull up a seat , catch up , ” Abdur goes to pass me the MLFB . “ No thanks , ” I can only partake in private , or social interaction goes from nerve wracking to excruciating . “ Suit yourself , ” Abdur ’ s wearing shades , the Visine only goes so far . “ You seen Kim ? ” Tyler asks , “ She said she was coming. ” “ Uh , no. ” The sun ’ s in my eyes . “ She ambushed you inside ? ” Tyler ’ s smiling . “ You need to just be straight with her man , ” Abdur is gon na make for a great life-coach someday . “ I know… ” “ Your problem is you try so hard to please everyone , you don ’ t think about yourself . And when you do that , you ’ re cheating them . Well I mean not Kim , she feeds on that but- ” “ Tell me about it. ” “ Look buddy , I know exactly how you feel , ” Abdur raises his shades and wants to have like a man to man moment . Goddamnit . “ You feel like you have to make people happy , comfortable . Well you can ’ t man . You literally can not worry about that . When you try so hard you ’ re doing the opposite – you ’ re putting people on edge . They can tell . We can tell , ” He waggles a hitchhiker ’ s thumb between himself and Tyler , “ I used to be like you man , so worried all the time about what people think . But here ’ s the thing – you can ’ t do an effin thing about it . People want the real you man , not like this persona you try so hard to portray . I know because that was me . And believe me , when you ’ re brown in a town like this people stare . But you just got ta straighten up , brush it off , tell yourself you have the same right as anyone else to be here . Look , I had it bad and I got over that sh*t. If I could there ’ s no reason you can ’ t. ” “ …I know , ” my head ’ s declined , I ’ m shaking it in solemn agreement . “ No you don ’ t ! See this is exactly what I ’ m talking about . You ’ re agreeing with me but you aren ’ t really . Tell me to f**k off ! Don ’ t be a people pleaser ! ” “ Hey you got any SpaceApe on there ? ” thank you Tyler . “ Kode9 , hell yeah ! ” The sun ’ s frying me like an egg on blacktop . “ I got ta take a pisser , ” “ Sure , ” The party ’ s really winding down now . They were splitting cake around the table when I was headed back out earlier and I pretended like I forgot my present for Tyler at home . I walked a couple blocks down the hill to the park and sat myself on a bench and smoked a Marb light and hated myself for it . It ’ s pathetic and I know it . “ Tyler , this is for you. ” “ Thanks buddy ! Okay , let me guess , ” he shakes the package with a wry grin . “ Blue Velvet. ” “ How… ” “ You must ’ ve hinted at it last week or something . Hey Rob , I ’ m glad you could make it . Really , it means a lot. ” “ Of course my dude ! Just can ’ t believe I forgot your present at home . Missed the cake , ” “ Yeah . So we still doubling tomorrow ? ” On the way back , kicking myself in penitence , I sigh and look skyward . The clouds are gossamer now , like gauze I think .': '5 4 3 3 3', \"When Artigan saw the a wisp of smoke rise from the forest cover , the chill that went through his spine had nothing to do with the hint of coming snow in the air . He picked up the pace and walked toward the source of the smoke . Was it another hiker ? Or maybe two ? The evening air suddenly felt more alive , almost electric . The anticipation made his mouth water and the shivering feeling in his stomach made it difficult for him to breathe . He was feeling giddy with the prospect of a kill on the hill . The garotte in his pocket was like a living thing and he patted it with a loving touch . `` Soon , my lovely . Soon . '' When he reached the fire , he was slightly disappointed to see it was just one man instead of two . For a moment he wondered who the hell treks alone . But then he realized that he was trekking alone too . `` Hey , hello there , '' Artigan said to the man who sat on a log with his back toward him . The man did n't move . He just kept his hands extended towards the fire . `` Hello , Artigan . Please join me . '' Artigan paused . The man knew his name . Which meant the man knew about him and what he did . Artigan thought about his choices , he could turn and go back where he had come from or he could join the man and find out how he knew his name before slicing his head off and eating his brain . His curiosity got the best of him and he walked up to the small fire . The man looked up to him and Artigan saw that his face was criss crossed with scars . Jagged wounds that had long healed but left their marks . When the man smiled , his pointed canines shone like diamonds in the semi darkness . Artigan felt a strange mixture of revulsion , lust and happiness in his chest . This was no one else but The Cross . The famous serial killer who crossed the faces of his victims after killing them . Artigan was not only a fan of the man but he positively idolized him . And he knew Artigan 's name ! And now Artigan had the opportunity to take his idol 's head ! Could this evening get any better ? He extended his hand towards the man who had earned a reputation based on unrivaled violence in the serial killer community . He was almost the level of a senior . A legend ! `` Sir , big big fan of your work . You 've been a true inspiration for my work . '' The man did n't take his hand . `` But , you , Artigan , you 've been a disgrace to our community . It 's people like you who give our work a bad name . '' Shit , thought Artigan as the man clasped his hand in his iron grip and a flash of steel from his other hand swung towards Artigan 's face . He flinched and that saved his life . The trademark serrated knife in Cross ' hand nearly scrapped through his eyeball . He had the garotte out in a flash , and he swung the weighed end around the other man 's neck . The choking sound he heard meant he had looped perfectly and now it was all about raw strength . He pulled the wire and Cross freed his hand to try and get his fingers under the garotte . But his other hand still had the knife and now he was also closer to Artigan . The knife flashed again and again in the falling darkness , and Artigan felt the sharp bite of the blade on his neck , face and chest . Blood filled his mouth but he managed to grab the other end of the garotte . He pulled and sliced with all his might and felt the wire bite into the flesh and tissue of the neck . The sharp tang of blood filled his nostrils , the same familiar feeling he had enjoyed so many times before . But his strength was fading . cross still jabbed at him with the wicked knife but his jabs had lost the will behind them . The two killers fell on the ground as fatigue and blood loss caught up with them . The first snow of winter started to fall and Artigan smiled at the numbness that was spreading through his body . He had had his kill . That was all that mattered .\": '5 5 5 5 5', \"Overall the idea is solid , and the style fits the plot . It has the feel of a fairy-tale with its narrative style . There are a few things I noticed right off the bat . In the first paragraph you used the word `` poor '' four times in three sentences . I would suggest maybe varying it , > He lived in the poor part of the city , for he was poor . He made clothes for poor workers , and was paid very little for even his best work . He was poor , but he was happy . An alternative could be : * He lived in the slums of the city , for he was hard on money . He made clothes for workers like him , and was paid very little even for his best work . He was poor , but he was happy . * If you change your words every so often it keeps the reader 's interest that little bit longer . I notice that you use the word `` poor '' a few more times in the story , so try playing around with vocabulary each time . In your third paragraph , you use parenthesis . This is n't a bad thing , but in most stories , one would try to avoid using them . I would try incorporating it into the story , so instead of > He was so extremely tired when he went into his bedroom ( which was just above his shop ) , but as soon as he lay down , he immediately felt wide awake . You could say : *He was so extremely tired when he went to his room above the shop* I found this sentence awkward in a few other ways as well . The phrasing `` he was so extremely tired '' leaves me expecting the continuation * ... that [ blank ] happened* . It would be a good idea to either split the sentence in two or change *He was so extremely tired* to *He felt his exhaustion* . The sentence would feel smoother that way as you lead into the *but as soon as he lay down* . There are a few more sentences that bug me , but I ca n't quite put my finger on them . A saw one that was borderline a run-on sentence in your last paragraph ( *No ... In reality , he was Mr. Alexander Black* ) As a few last notes , I would probably expand the paragraph with the dream . In both your intro and concluding paragraph you bring back the idea of food , shelter and warmth . The first time with him being content with his meager lifestyle , the second time with what was once satisfactory not being enough anymore . I like the shift from the positive to downcast , but the dream with the fine red and gold cloak does n't quite fit the theme that you established . So , if possible , try to bring the idea of food , shelter and warmth into the dream . What did the king eat that was better ? How was the king 's bed better ? How was the fireplace better ? Answering these questions would make a greater contrast to his life and tie the dream into the rest of the story a bit better . It would certainly explain why the tailor woke up and suddenly was n't satisfied with his way of life anymore . I hope this critique is n't too harsh . Like I said , you 've got a solid story . If you make any changes ( even if they are n't my suggestions because let 's be honest , I 'm no expert ) , let me know . I 'll be happy to read it again .\": '5 5 3 4 1', \"`` Do it , coward , '' the voice in his head urges . And he does . Suddenly , he is thrown into another world . He sees himself , walking , shaking hands , receiving his papers , walking away in deep blue robes and laughing in victory . He sneers and then is ripped away , swirling , lost in color as a new scene comes into focus . A woman . Long , brunette hair . High cheek bones . Deep blue eyes the color of the Aegean in spring . The woman giggles , laughing at some unheard joke . He ca n't help but smile ... `` Who ... '' The world spins and he is torn away again , This time to a storm in a forest . The drumming of the rain drowns out all other sound . Another man is yelling , but ca n't be heard . Suddenly the voice cuts through the wet splashing . `` RUN . '' He follows the man 's instructions , a sense of overwhelming dread flowing over him . An unnoticeable tree stump grabs a hold of his foot , hurling him into the mud . This is the end . He ca n't bear it . Just as the dread is about to drown him he flashes to another scene . The woman is there , and the yelling man too . `` What ... '' `` Bout time you woke up ! '' The woman giggles and he feels the smile bubbling to his face again . He jumps forward . The woman is still there , but older now . Lines have appeared in her forehead , as well as curves around her mouth and little crinkles next to her eyes . Still , she retains all of her beauty . `` We 're going to be late for the graduation ! '' Now she is lying in a bed . Beep . She wears nothing but a robe . Beep . Much older now , the lines are thicker . And her hair is grey . There are strange machines around , a symphony of beeps and clicks and whirs and wooshes . Beep . People outside the room seem busy , rushing to and fro . Beep . `` It does n't hurt , '' she croaks quietly . She closes her eyes , as the beeps grow further apart . Beep . She mutters something else , `` I ... . love ... you .

The gun clicks .\": '4 4 5 5 5', 'Taylor rushed past the hordes of reporters that lined the pathways of the spacious university campus . She dashed in and out between the teams of reporters preparing to go live in a matter of minutes , without causing a second glance in her direction . It felt like a lifetime since the news had been made public , when in reality , the leak had gone live two hours ago . No one quite knew of what to make of the news . How could anyone react to realization that we had never been the only ones in the universe ? To make matters even more puzzling , the fish like sentient creature had been discovered right in our solar system- right on Jupiter ’ s own Europa . Before Taylor even had time to make any sense of the news , she had received a call from her boss to rush directly to the “ stage ” as he liked to call his prep room for the presidential debates . When Taylor finally pushed her way to the locked classroom door , she knocked twice and entered the dark room to find her boss hunched over a nightlight and a humidifier . “ Taylor have you heard ? ” He asked without looking up from the light . She nodded . “ I have . Now what ? ” The year was 2020 and the presidential election was being hyped up more than ever before . Nobody in a thousand years could have ever predicted the outcome of the 2016 election . With only ten days to go before the general election , Hillary Clinton , after being fed up with Trump ’ s sexist remarks , challenged Trump to a bake-off . If Trump could bake a better devil ’ s food cake , then she would renounce her bid for the presidency . Much to everyone ’ s surprise , the guy could bake some of the best cake anyone could ever have . However , to no one ’ s surprise , when Donald Trump entered the presidency , he shrugged off his idea to build a giant wall and focused his attention of expanding the space program . Drawing money from his own personal fortune , Donald Trump turned the United States space program into the best in the world . When asked why he cared so much about space exploration , typical Trump would respond that he wanted to have another option in case those damn Muslim terrorist blew up the Earth . Everyone had always assumed that Trump would run for reelection , but he insisted that he didn ’ t intend to stay in office for more than four years . Now , if people thought that Trump running for president was crazy that was nothing to what the 2020 presidential candidates were . Sure some were extremely well qualified , but others , let ’ s just say no one ever considered would be running . Among those was rapper Kanye West , who ran with the Democrat party . Somehow , he rose to the top of the polls , and before anyone could say are we really doing this again , another entertainer became a contender for the white house . Nobody for the life of them could figure out how they got Kanye West vs Sarah Palin 2020 . Taylor snapped the compact mirror shut and tossed it into her tote before looking at the man sitting across from her on the private jet as they flew straight towards the Hollywood Hills . He was dressed in an immaculate black tux , a new look for him . She stayed quiet as she waited for the man to speak . After all , he had called her and she wasn ’ t one to speak unless spoken to . After a brief moment of silence , the rapper cleared his throat and tapped his hand on the table . “ Taylor , I understand that we haven ’ t been on speaking terms of as lately , but I need your help. ” Taylor stayed silent and feigned disinterest as she turned her head to look at the dozens of aquariums scattered throughout the plane . “ As you ’ ve probably heard , I ’ m running for president in 2020 and I ’ ve got a serious problem . I ’ ve done a fair bit of polls and research on my end and it appears I might have this election in the bag . I need you to make sure it stays that way. ” Taylor laughs and shakes her head . “ What do you need me for . You can hire the very best campaign manager money can buy . I don ’ t have any political experience and quite frankly I could care less about this type of stuff. ” “ That ’ s true , but you are the very best at keeping people ’ s attention . I want you to make sure that the public continues to pay attention as I lay low for a while . And perhaps maybe even stir up some dirt on Palin while you ’ re at it . I can assure you that you will be very justly rewarded for this. ” Kanye folds his fingers on top of each other and stares in Taylor ’ s direction . “ Why would you stay low at a time like this. ” “ Let ’ s just say Mr. Trump is onto something huge that I have a personal stake in . Now , do we have a deal or not ? ” Taylor laughs and begins to stand up from her seat before Kanye grabs her hand and holds her in place . “ I can help make them pay . All of those guys who left you without a second glance in your direction won ’ t have the last word . After all , everyone assumes that Guantanamo shut down , and who ’ s to say that is or is not true . Paper work gets lost all the time and sometimes try as we might stuff happens by accident. ” Kanye smiles at the last bit . Taylor looks over at Kanye and sits back down . Perhaps she could listen , if only for just a second . “ Taylor , I need you to get the word out. ” Kanye half whispers . Taylor frowns in confusion . “ This is weird , I ’ m going to turn the lights on , ” she says . Before Kanye can stop her , Taylor flips the light switch on . She stifles a scream as she realizes that she is surrounded by hundreds if not thousands of fish bowls with fish floating in them . Right in front of her , Kanye is dressed in an aqua metallic wet suit . “ What ’ s going on ? ” She manages to get out . Kanye smiles and outstretches his hands . “ Don ’ t you understand Swift ; this recent discovery has helped me come to terms with who I am . It ’ s time that everyone knew . After this , I ’ m going to renounce my bid for presidency and give my support for you. ” Taylor ’ s heart picks up in excitement . “ Okay then , what should I tell the awaiting public ? ” She asks . “ Tell them that I , Kanye West , am a gay fish. ”': '5 4 5 5 5', \"`` Two yesterday . Decided they wanted a piece of my garden . How about you , Kenneth ? '' I looked up from my notepad , my attention yanked suddenly to the conversation at hand . `` I uh ... What ? '' `` How many have you killed this week ? '' I shrugged , feeling a distinct rush from the lie I was about to tell . `` Not sure . Five or six , I suppose . '' The three others stared at me . `` Six ? Really ? '' I nodded . `` Well , or five . I said five too . I do n't really remember . '' Ferd hopped off the hood of the car he 'd been sitting on . `` Uh huh . And that 's why you 've gotten all red , I 'm sure . How old are you , Kenneth ? '' I sighed . `` Nearly twelve . Why 's it matter ? '' `` Ha ! By twelve I 'd had at least a dozen kills under my belt . Sister was the first . '' Chip shouted proudly . He was sixteen , the oldest in our group . `` So what ? '' I retorted indignantly . `` Not like I 've never killed a zombie before . '' The others blinked at me . `` Oh my god , '' Chelsea muttered . `` You 've never killed a zombie have you ? '' I shook my head , feeling the inevitable blush rising in my face . My signature tell and not a thing I could do about it . Still , I persisted . `` Sure I have ! I love killing zombies . I love ... smushing their heads in , you know . Like big bags of.. sand . '' I made a squishing motion with my hands , driving home my point . Chip nearly doubled over laughing . `` Bags of sand ! ? Are you serious ? '' Ferd walked to the overhang where I 'd been taking shelter from the heat . `` What are you drawing there , Ken ? '' `` I , uh.. - Hey ! '' Before I had a chance to react he 'd grabbed the book from me and climbed the nearest bus , waving it above his head . `` OOohh , look at this ! Some sort of shitty little sword ! How cute ! Hey Chip , you think we can start using swords to kill zombies now ? '' The others began laughing too and I felt a burning sensation start to sting my eyes . I knew the feeling ; I was about to cry . So I ran . I turned tail , leaving my precious pen and notepad . They 'd been my two dearest friends for as long as I could remember and I left them without a second thought . The worst part is that I left them to avoid *more* embarrassment . As if there would ever be a way to redeem myself . I sprinted past the rows of cars , following the highway as far as it would take me . Before long my sprint became a jog and my jog became a saunter . By the time the sun had begun setting I was strolling lazily along . Some part of me wanted Chip , Ferd and Chelsea to chase after me but they 'd probably moved on already . Kids joined and left on a daily basis , some voluntarily and others , well ... . My stomach growled . A sign listed the nearest town : Alamosa , 12 miles . And that 's when I saw her . A little girl , missing one arm , trying to open the door of a car . It looked like she wanted nothing more than to get inside , but could n't quite muster the movements required to clutch the handle . I looked at her , then behind me to ensure no one had chased after me . After I was satisfied , I approached her . Slowly at first was the rule with these things . Make a sudden movement and they would lunge at you . But as I walked up to her , I realized why she wanted so badly to enter the car . *Her pet . * She turned to look at me , her dead eyes scanning me before turning back to the door . I reached forward , edging my hand around her left side so that she would have to turn in order to grab me . I felt the handle and tugged it lightly . Gravity did the rest and the door swung open . I retreated as slowly as I 'd approached , watching the girl 's motions . She made her way inside , oblivious to my presence and curled up next to a dog 's rotting carcass . Finally content , her eyes closed and she appeared to sleep . I knew that was it for her . She shivered in her final moments , the same way my parents had after lying down next to me . My kill count remained at zero because after all this time I could n't bring myself to harm the otherwise peaceful creatures . I knew I could tell the others about this , tell them I 'd murdered a zombie in cold blood . But that would n't change the truth and it would n't change them . I had yet to meet someone who understood the dead the way I did . That was alright , though . I was only twelve then .

The village head gave him the last of the town 's food and told him to get to the next town , to get food for the rest of them , to save them . His stomach growled , the pain of hunger was taking him too , albeit slowly . His mind shifted to the 2 loaves of bread in his bag . The man was tempted , but he could n't eat them .

The monument which must have once gleamed in the sun was eroded by the wind , just a mountain of dirt now . Whoever had made this had died centuries ago .

I sat motionless in the dark , and a sorrowful breath escaped my lips . I fucked up again . I thought she would be different . Sure , I might have came across as a bit shy , but who does n't ? I caught her smiles so many times I could n't even count , each one unique like a snowflake . She sent me winks , compliments and wishes - which I tried my best and more to try and fulfill them . But I was wrong . Maybe I had read it wrong , or maybe she did n't know me - either way , I was once again banished to the realm of the forsaken friendzone , with nothing but a cold emptiness emanating from my heart . The thunder flashed outside , startling me slightly . 'Terrific . ' I thought . It seemed that even the weather was bringing me down . There was another flash , but this time , I did not hear the thunder . Instead , I heard whispers that entered my ears like some slimy snake , leaving an unpleasant feeling in my mind . My teeth clenched as I realized I had heard this before , but I could not remember when . What was it ? Was it during the 14th birthday ? Was it during last Christmas ? What was it ? As if to answer my question , something black and dusty exploded in front of me , causing me to be blown back into my bed . The figure materialized steadily , and I could make out image through the silhouette . It was a woman , wearing a dark pointed hat , with hair black as a street cat 's , with a robe that unified the colors . She blinked , her blue , hollow eyes glowing in the dark , and then shifted her gaze on me . I had barely enough time to recover myself when she stormed in front of me and grabbed me by the shirt . `` You ! '' She shrieked . An explosion of black smoke hissed out of her mouth as she spoke . `` W-what ? '' I stammered . I raised my hands in a surrendering gesture , but it had little effect . `` We had a deal ! '' `` Who are you ? '' I asked . She was then silent - but only for a split second . To my surprise , she released me , and clicked her fingers . In an instant , a piece of paper materialized in front of her . `` Four years ago . December the fifth . At the party . '' She stated . I carefully took the paper from her slim , bony hands , and looked over it cautiously . I was surprised to find that I could read the letters quite accurately , despite being in the dark . My face changed to confusion when I realized what the paper had said . I was to promise her me firstborn , in exchange for musical talent . Trying my best not to offend her , even taking into consideration that she may be offended by the way I looked at her , I extended the paper back to her . She snatched it without a word . `` I do n't understand . '' I said in my best feeble voice . `` You promised me your firstborn ! '' She shrieked again . The room was getting darker each time her mouth was open . `` I did ! '' I protested . `` It 's not my fault I ca n't get any girls !

I sighed , and showed her computer . `` Look . '' I pointed . The witch peered at the screen with narrowed eyes , and began scrolling through my chat log . I did not bother reading it again , and instead found entertainment in her reactions . Her face changed from a dreamy smile , to a raised eyebrow , to an approving look , to a grimace . She then looked at me , and scratched her head . `` In five years , she 's the only one you 've been talking to ? I mean , there has to be others right ? '' She asked . I sighed again , but added a shrug . `` But ... Why ? '' She asked me . I opened my mouth to speak - my intended answer was to be something melancholy and gentlemanly , but I closed my mouth . I felt a strange anger bubble out from inside me , and I felt the cork pulverize into dust as the fiery emotions exploded out into verbal form . `` I do n't fucking know ! '' I shouted . The witch was more taken back then before , and this time it was her turn to collapse on my bed . `` I mean , I 'm not even that bad looking right ? '' I looked at her with eyes of anger , rather than of desperation . The witch gulped and nodded . Her eyes then caught the bottle of liquor next to my monitor . `` I mean , I 'm a nice guy , I do n't treat woman badly - hell I do n't even insult them ! '' I carried on . I felt my face turn red , but I refused to believe it was the alcohol . `` But what happens ? Nothing ! Absolutely goddamn nothing ! I asked twenty three girls out - after getting to know them , know their favorite colors , their hobbies , their favorite movies , their favorite music - hell , I even found a girl that likes Heavy Metal like me , and what happens ? Nothing !

It 's always with the friendship ! She 's got a million friends on facebook for crying out loud ! '' The witch began fading into black smoke , but it was slow . She began muttering faster , while looking at me and nodding with a static look . `` Hell , if she wanted friends she should be a goddamn Carebear !

We sat in spiritual silence , Pa 's jaw grinding slowly back and forth on itself the way it did in church when the priest took too long with the homily .

I have to make sure I make it right , I have a lot of work to do . I am the captain of the Captain 's ship , the largest ship in the sea , and I am responsible for the survival of the crew . I ca n 't take this job for granted . I want to be the best captain I can be , I want my crew to be happy , I need to be able to fit in , I 'm not sure I can . I need a new ship . I got ta get out of here . I just need to get the ship to the coast . I can do this . I will be the captain , I will get it ! I have the knowledge to do it ! The crew will be happy . I must go . I shall take the ship . If I 'd been able . If only I could have done this before . I had to make it , I would n't have to do that . I would have been able , but I could n't . I wish I could . I was n't able to , I ca't . The ship is too big , the crew is too strong . I could never get the crew to move . I keep telling myself I ' m not going to do anything . I really wish I had n't made it . I should n't be the Captain . I did n't make it . The crew is my only hope . I reached into my pocket and pulled out a small box of coins . I put them in the box and handed them to the captain . I told him to open it and to hold onto it . He took a look and said , `` This is my first time doing this , I did this before , I do it . '' The captain took the coins and handed it to me . I took the money and walked out of the ship , I looked around the ship and saw the crew , they were all in the ship as well . I walked up to the Captain and told him that I wanted to take the treasure . I asked if he wanted to be my captain . He said yes . I followed him and we went to the deck and I asked him if he was ready . He was . We took the treasure and we walked back to the ship for a little bit . I said , I am going to be a good captain , and that I want a ship that can take care of my crew . He replied , `` I am ready to do what I can to make this ship a better ship . '' I said . I gave him a look , he looked at me , and he said , '' I am not ready to let you go . '' He took the gold and gave it to us . I looked at the crew and said : `` I know what I want .

With the curtains closed our worlds become almost the same . At any rate , the light is just as warm to me as it is to her . If I close my eyes , we can be one . I can see the keys before me , can see the soft twisting of light they reflect as I play them , but they are silent to me . I only know the music they make is beautiful because she tells me so . My world is bright and colourful , but it is quiet . She is the only one who speaks to me . Not just with the flourishes of her hands as she signs to me how pretty the new tune I 've written is , but also in the soft touch of her fingers on my skin , her light breath on my face , and the worlds she creates on canvas . She tells me I am beautiful in a way I can never know . And somehow it means more when she says it . She 's not the only one who does ; so many others have called me a genius , an inspiration . A deaf pianist , what a miracle ! I do n't think it 's a miracle . If it was , I would n't know . I see the keys , I play them , they say it makes them feel something beautiful but it means nothing to me . All I know is what she tells me . And I struggle to speak back because speaking is hard for me , and I do n't know what she hears when I do . What I say is probably different from what I mean , and I ca n't know if it is or not . I find I can not sign happiness or sadness or love and give it the same meaning it has in my heart . And when I compose , I ca n't understand my own songs . The only way I can really speak to others is when I write . But my words are silent , and they can not speak to her . And yet I still speak to her better than anyone else , without knowing how . All I know is that she hears me , and she loves what she hears . Maybe it 's the same as why I love her . She touches me in a way that she can not understand . She creates beautiful worlds that I try to describe to her , but my words are never enough . She 'll never know what her creations make me feel , but maybe that is what makes them so wonderful . It 's hard to hold back tears when I stop to think about it . She is my inspiration . She lets me know what I make her feel by making me feel the same way . She is a miracle , and the words 'blind painter ' do n't even begin to describe why . She lights this word with a light she can not see , gives it a meaning she can not understand , she exists to create a paradise open to everyone but herself . And so I finally understand . This is what I am to her , this is what I make her feel . We may not be able to know the beauty in ourselves , but we can know the beauty of each other . She is the meaning in my life , and I am the meaning in hers . I do n't know how , but I can feel these words rush through me and into the notes I am playing . She places a hand on my arm , and I know that I feel as warm to her as she feels to me . I smile at her and see that she 's singing .

When you hit the ground , they will be shooting at you . Shoot them first . '' My parents did n't amount to much , but they were fantastic parents . I am their only child so when I got drafted , their initial response was to pack my bags and send me off to my cousin in South Africa . Before the war I had n't been hit by the patriotism bug that many had , but when I saw a picture of the Prom King that I went to school with head 's cut in two by the blade of a downed MiG , I knew I could not pass off the call when it came . As I stood at the now open door of the plane , it was this memory that took my mind off Mather 's comment long enough to forget about vomiting . I glanced down at the grey Stars and Stripes patch on my uniform and leapt from the plane . The first few moments after the jump were a blur . Even now I do n't remember any of it . I 'd zoned out until a crack snapped past my head . The fuckers were firing anti-aircraft rounds at us . Cheap shot . At least it was pitch black , but they got damn close considering they were firing blind . `` Contact '' shouted Mathers . It was way too late to change course and I pulled my chute . The sound of a parachute opening is always a relief . At least when you are n't being shot at from the ground . I could hear the chutes of my comrades launch . The radio crackled . `` Is everyone OK ? '' Mathers asked in an unusually nervous tone . I do n't think even he had experienced anything like that before . We took the term sitting ducks to a new level that night . `` Jones , Graham , Thompson , Baker ... '' . The register was entirely met with ayes . The firing from the ground stopped . We landed 2 clicks East of our intended destination but after looking at the team , I do n't think any of them cared . They looked drawn out . Zombie-like almost . I had never felt more alive . My heart was pumping but it felt good . It was euphoric . Tough-nut Mathers had already composed himself and pinpointed on his map where we had to go . The Spanish air smelled sweet . We were set to rendezvous in the rebel held City of Valencia . The Russian/German alliance had been decimated by a series of allied nuclear attacks in France , Poland and and Southern Russia . The UK Prime Minister ordered the attacks after intelligence advised of a planned German invasion from France . History always seems to repeat itself . 17 million had died as a result of the allied bombs . When it happened I could n't believe it , but not I felt as though I could take the rebels on by hand . I was ready to fight . I was ready to die . I did n't enjoy school , and from what I 've already said you can gather that I was n't Prom King . Not even close in fact . I was quite literally last in line to the throne . Probably behind a few of the girls too , I might add . I 'm not particularly hideous and certainly not overweight but in the social jungle of High School I chose to keep myself to myself . I 'm not sure why I was thinking about school as we trecked silently through nighttime Spain . The occasional gun shot could be heard but the Spanish rebels were hardly the most reserved characters . We were on the edge of the city when we came across a Humvee by the side of the road . It was strange purely because there were n't supposed to be any Allied forces in this area yet . As we got closer to it we found a puddle of blood behind the wheel . I brought my gun up ready to fire . I was damn ready to kill someone . I peered into the vehicle to find a headless Marine . I should have been disgusted but I was n't . I was excited . I overheard Jones muttering away while I was in the Humvee searching for anything useful . `` CONTACT RIGHT '' `` CONTACT LEFT '' What the fuck . All at once . This was it . The moment . I scrambled to get out of the Humvee , slipped in the excitement and slammed my head into the door frame thing . As I came to I saw Jones get shot in the head . Splat . That was him done . My excitement turned to dismay . CHRIST . Where had his face gone . Were they shooting bricks ? Damn . There was nothing left from the shoulders up . I was lucky to be covered by the vehicle . I duck down and collect my thoughts . The feeling of being alive was back . Stronger this time . I did n't want to lose it . I soon realised why Jones had no head left when anti-aircraft rounds slammed into the Humvee . Poor Jones had taken a round to the head . He died like Obama in Kingsman . Losing his head in a puff of smoke . I looked across at Mathers who had found his way into a ditch . They 'd taken out th attackers on the right while I was out cold . He pointed at the Humvee I was hiding behind . He wanted me to get on the mounted 50 cal . Okay . I climbed into the Humvee and peered out a hole in the back . The shooting stopped . Something had jammed in their gun in the back of a pick up truck . This was my moment . I jumped up , readied the weapon and fired . They noticed and tried to run but it was too late . My bullets cut them down . 10s of lives ended just like that . One of them only looked like a kid . 15 maybe , but I did n't care . `` Good job , Private . '' Barked Mathers . I went over to him . He patted me on the back and I threw up . `` That 's war for you . '' He was right . That was war .

It was the end of his shift on a humid Saturday where all he could think about was the summer party happening later that night . And Tessa . Most of the bookstore 's patrons made their way out of the cramped wooden door well before closing time . All except for the mist eyed man . He had been thumbing through books in every section , then shaking his head in disappointment before moving onto another shelf . Malcolm watched him glide through the sci-fi section , onto romance and business books before finally landing in religion and staying there for a while . Malcolm eyes kept straying back to the clock that now read 5:55 pm , and then back to the man who had a stack of books ringing the creaky old wooden chair in the far corner of the shop . He sighed to himself and began re-shelving stray books while throwing glances in the corner occasionally at the quiet old man . Finally , some minutes later , the strange man rose from his place and walked over to the counter . Oddly , he had no books in hand as he shuffled his way up to the counter top . `` Excuse me . '' the man said shaking voice worn down by age and experience `` I hope I 'm not bothering you , good sir . I 'm looking for something that does n't exist .

'' He looked back over his shoulder `` I think one of these books may be able to help me , but I 'm not sure which ? Malcolm checked the clock again . 6:01 pm . `` I 'm sorry sir , but we 're actually closed now . '' He explained `` Maybe you could come back tomorrow ? I 'm sure someone could help you as much as you need then . '' The man heaved a tremendous sigh . `` No ... no it must be today . That 's quite alright then , '' the man turned back toward the door `` perhaps within the next 100 years then . '' `` Wait ! '' Malcolm was n't sure why he was shouting , but the man stood stone still either way . `` Ah , 100 years ? What do you mean ? '' The man turned back , and shuffled his way up to the counter . Leaning forward he drew Malcolm in and whispered `` Yes , once every 100 years something that does n't exist , does . It 's only for the briefest of moments but it will revolutionize the way you see the world . '' Malcolm was intrigued . He thought about checking the clock again , after all the party started at 7 but then , he figured , how long could it take to help an old man find a book ? `` Well , I can make a bit of time I suppose . What kind of book is it ? '' `` Books . '' the old man corrected . He made his way back to the various shelves and began thumbing through the same books again . `` An author has a particular way of writing . A voice , if you will . This very special thing demands that the right voices come together in harmony . '' He pulled an old , worn fantasy book down from the shelf and thumbed through it before handing it back to Malcolm . `` Harmony ? '' he asked , while taking the book from the man 's frail hands . `` Yes , yes harmony . Everything in the world is wrought in harmony and books are no different . Ah ! Here . '' He 'd gathered a collection of books from every genre and indicated for Malcolm to lay them all out . Malcolm obeyed , laying the books side by side while opening each to a different page . `` Yes , here this one should be page 219 . And this , here should be page 15 .

We looked at the ball . `` Is it a soul ? '' the Scientist asked . It nodded . The scientists looked at us . `` Okay , '' they said . The man turned back to the ball , `` What do you think ?

I kept my eyelids shut out of fear that if I opened them , my eyeballs would be ripped out of their sockets . The pain abruptly stopped and for a split second I felt nothing before landing hard on my back . A cool breeze washed over me and the warmth of the sun radiated on my face . I heard the sirens of an ambulance wailing somewhere nearby . I opened my eyes to see where I was but my vision was obscured by the bright sunlight . I sat up . As my vision adjusted I was able to make out a sign above me that read Murphtown City Hospital . The hospital building was at least 15 or 20 stories tall , the outside bricks were painted a light shade of red and the entire front of the building was covered with windows . The architecture of this time is very different from what I was used to back home . As I stood up a small torn paper fell out of my jacket pocket . I picked it up and found the words “ Jeremy Walter ” written on it . That was all they could tell me before they sent me whirling through space and time . Find “ Jeremy Walter ” . When I walked into the hospital I spotted a young lady sitting behind a receptionist desk . As I made my way over I tried to think of how I could explain ... everything . I decided I would just tell her the truth . She had to believe me . She just had to . The survival of the entire human race was at stake . The lady at the desk looked up and said “ Hello , my name is Rachel ! Welcome to Murphtown City Hospital ! How may I assist you ? ” as I reached the desk . Well… here goes . “ Hey . Yeah . So um . I am not really sure how to put this so I am just going to lay it down straight. ” I gained more confidence as I spoke . “ I am from the future . A future where humanity is on the brink of total annihilation . The event that will lead to inevitable extinction of humanity occurred on this day and – “ Rachel cut me off . “ Sir , I don ’ t know what game you are trying to play here but this is a hospital . If you can ’ t behave accordingly I am going to have to ask you to leave . Now if you could please move aside so I can help the next person in the line. ” I turned around to see 2 other people waiting behind me . Dammit ! She doesn ’ t believe me . “ Please , just listen to me ! I am not playing any games this is serious ! ” Rachel stood up , “ Sir I am going to have to call security If you refuse to step aside. ” She said frowning . “ Alright , alright . I don ’ t care if you believe my story or not but could you just tell me who Jeremy Walter is ? ” Rachel sighed , ignoring my question she picked up her phone and dialed a few numbers . “ Yes , I need security to come down to the main desk . Mhm . Yes . I have a disruptive man here that is refusing to leave. ” I tried to talk over her “ No you don ’ t understand ! Please just tell me , Jeremy Walter , do you know who he is ? ! ” Rachel put down the phone and said “ Sir , please just wait here . Security will be here soon to escort you out . Thank you. ” Before I could think of what else to say two uniformed men walked up behind me and grabbed both of my arms . I flailed my legs around frantically trying to stop the men from dragging me out of the hospital . “ NO STOP ! PLEASE ! YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME ! ” I kicked and screamed but they would n't stop . As we got closer to the exit I turned my head to see a new born child in a small bassinet bin , on a cart , being pushed into the hospital . Written on the bin was the name “ Jeremy Walter ” in large black letters . “ THERE ! OVER THERE ! THATS HIM ! LET GO OF ME ! ” A sudden pulse of strength erupted from my muscles and I managed to knock over the two security officers that were dragging me . All three of us fell to the ground . I got back up as quickly as I could and bolted toward the baby . Instinct drove me , without thinking I slammed my body hard into the nurse that was pushing the cart . I grabbed hold of the babies cart , pushing it with me as I ran down a hallway and out of sight . I could hear the commotion of the people behind me and the security guards running in after me . I turned left as the hallway turned into a T-intersection and continued running . Another left . Then a right . Then ... A dead end ! No , wait ? There ! A flight of stairs on the right ! There was no way I would be able to push the cart up the stairs so I quickly , but carefully , picked up the child in my arms and started running up the stairs two at a time . Down in the distance I could hear the guards yell `` He ran up the stairs ! '' . What was I doing ? This is a child in my arms that was no more than a few days old . This could n't be a coincidence though . I was sent to this exact time , and landed in this exact place . This had to be him . This must be what I was sent here to do . I was met at the top of the staircase with a closed metal door . I peaked over the edge of the stairwell to see four security guards running up , guns in hand . I opened the door and ran out to find myself on the roof of the hospital . This was it . There 's no where else to go . I ran over to the edge of the roof and tried to look for a way down . I heard a voice call out behind me . `` Put that child down NOW ! '' I turned around to see four guns pointing at me ready to blow my brains out . I took a step back toward the edge . `` DO N'T YOU DARE TAKE ANOTHER STEP . '' Tears were flowing down my face . I needed them to understand . `` Do n't shoot ! Please ! Ca n't you see I am trying to help you . I am trying to save all of you ! This child . Jeremy Walter . He 's the beginning of the end . But it does n't have to be that way !

One of the officers put his gun back in its holster and stepped forward . `` Sir . You are not thinking straight . '' He inched closer and closer as he spoke . `` Look down in your arms .

He was a hulk of a man , if I ever saw one , and there was never a terror he wouldn ’ t face without his fists . It used to be that he ’ d charge into battle and dominate the field . This girl ’ s not on his level but she carries her own strength . Even now , as she faces down twelve of my men , she doesn ’ t blink an eye – even though I know it must be hard for her . My men are some of the most elite you ’ ll ever meet , having come from various backgrounds of ex-militia , mercenary work or a mixture of both . She ’ s not doing that well , if I have to be honest . It probably doesn ’ t help that there are cameras on her , broadcasting this to the public at large . I ’ m looking at my cell phone and I know that this is going viral as we speak . All-American is a pretty good brawler but the men I ’ ve got are practically making mince-meat out of her . I don ’ t even think I ’ ll have to touch her . Once I ’ m done with this , I ’ m planning to fast-track my plan for national takeover . I ’ ve promised some politicians a few positions here and there to keep them mostly off my back . There ’ s some opposition in those circles too ; the ones who want to do right by their country . They won ’ t last long . In a way , I think I ’ m fighting for the same thing she ’ s fighting for – but she ’ s going about it all wrong . What America needs is someone to tell it what to do and keep it strictly in line , not some freedom-fighting cheerleader who ’ s clearly too young to see how humans fuck up everything . Am I saying I ’ m better than most humans ? Nah , I don ’ t think so – but individuality is part of the problem – this whole protection of people ’ s sense of self is just leading nowhere . What you need to do is force people into the same way of thinking , eliminate the differences and then you have the foundation for some actual peace . I ’ m not claiming to be an angel , but since I ’ m the only one doing anything about it , people are just gon na have to follow my lead . I ’ m making sure things happen for this country . No one ’ s coming to help All-American . There are a lot of stronger superheroes out there , some with actual superpowers who would put up a better fight . Most of those superheroes are worries of the past , since I took them out . See ? I have a plan . The only superheroes left really are the wannabes like All-American 2.0 or the ones who weren ’ t really much of heroes to begin with . I look down at the battle and I ’ m disappointed . All-American has taken out a good fair share of my men . I should ’ ve known better than to underestimate her . She ’ s not that impressive but there ’ s a certain resilience to her that shouldn ’ t be undermined . I often do that when it comes to her , she exudes that kind of vibe . Her costume is bloodied . As I descend a nearby staircase , I remained cloaked in shadows as I watch her attempt to take on five men at once . “ Stop ! ” I yell , pulling out a revolver . My bullet will hit right in between the eyes of All-American and I ’ m pretty sure of it . I ’ m a good shot . “ Some men you are . Can ’ t even take out Taylor Swift playing dress up , ” I smirk . My men are annoyed , but I don ’ t care . Shame is a useful weapon when it comes to teaching and I can not afford to welcome the next do-gooder with a display like this . I might not be there to deal with the next one . All-American flips towards me , I guess in some attempt to kick the gun out of my grip . I use my free hand to grab one of her legs and smack her into a nearby pillar . She cries out in agony as she hits the ground , but I grab her by the neck pressing her up to the pillar . “ Why are you doing this ? ” she asks , and a tear is actually streaming down her face . “ For a better America. ” “ You can ’ t honestly believe that , ” she says . “ You ’ re everything that America doesn ’ t stand for . Your whole manifesto is basically mind control , it ’ s taking away everything that makes a person an actual person . How can you even look yourself in the mirror and call yourself the Patriot ? ” That ’ s what I call myself : the Patriot . “ How can you do it ? We ’ re fighting for a better America , I ’ m fighting for my future . You can stop this , Patriot . They say you used to be good , that you used to be one of us . If you really were , you ’ d stop this now . You ’ d stop. ” She ’ s right when she says I used to be one of them . She doesn ’ t know how right she is . I press my gun to her temple . “ This is the only way America can have a future . This is the only way America can be a place of peace , a good place for the future . People like you , with your wild ideas of freedom and creativity will always be a threat to the norms of society . People like you will always be what ’ s wrong with America . People like you bring change that can not be regulated . What the world needs now is order – not your brand of do-gooder chaos. ” ’ I used to share the same dream she did . I used to think that by fighting for freedom , I was doing America a favor . I used to be just as All-American as she says she is . I used to be just like her until a group of people cornered the love of my life on a lonely road on a winter night and took a slugger to his skull . I used to think that fighting for America meant something – until I saw that there will always be differences that create chaos . So I will forge a better America with my own hands . I pull the trigger and rip off her mask . And the dream she has , the dream she thinks is worth something dies with her . And as she dies , I look into her eyes and I recognize her green eyes , her blonde hair . A face I ’ ve seen a thousand times . Hayley Morris , my late fiancé ’ s younger sister . Once a promising MIT student , now a crime fighter . I don ’ t remove my mask . I don ’ t let her know who I am . I used to be All-American . I used to feel All-American . Now I feel like no one .': '5 5 5 5 5', \"`` I 'm going to have to go . '' I said to the man I had been watching for the last few hours . He was a tall , dark man , and he was wearing a dark suit with a dark tie . He had a look of tiredness in his eyes . I knew he had been through a lot , and that was the reason he was still alive . `` You 're going to go , '' I told him . `` I 'll take you with me . '' He looked at me with a look that told me he was scared . `` No , I 've been waiting for you . '' `` No . I 'd like to go with you . I do n't want to be alone .

I looked up , and there was a man standing there . `` Yes , '' said the man , with a grin on his face . He smiled at me , and said , `` It was a good decision . '' We both looked at each other , and the man who had been looking at us and smiled said , '' It was the best decision I 's ever made . '' And then I took a step back , and looked at the man . He looked back at me . `` What are you going to do , '' asked the man in the suit . `` Go with me ? '' I asked , and we walked out the door . `` Do n't you want to take me with you ? '' he asked . `` Just go with me ! '' I yelled . `` And you will get your revenge ! '' he shouted , and with that , he ran away . I walked down the street , and out of the building , and into the woods . I took my time , and waited for the man to come back . I did n't have to wait long . I saw him , and when he came back , I could hear him crying . `` Why did you do that ? '' `` I could n't , '' was all I could say . `` The war is over , '' my voice was weak , and my voice cracked . `` There is no more war . '' It took a long time for me to get back to the house , and for the men to leave . I sat in the dark , and listened to the gunshot . I could feel my heart beating . I felt the blood on my hands , and it was cold , and hard . I heard the screams of the men as they ran by . I wanted to stop them . I was going to stop the war . I would n't let it end like this . I had to stop it . I turned around , and saw the man that had been staring at me stand up . He said , with his eyes full of fear , `` You are going to get your vengeance . '' and then he ran . I watched him run , and watched as he ran from the house . I stood there , and wondered what I would do . I reached the house and looked around . The house was empty , and no one was there . I left the house to go to the woods , and began to walk home . I ran , and ran , but I could not find the man at the door that I was looking for . I kept running , and running , but no one came . I continued on , and finally I reached my home . As I walked home , I saw the door , and in the house was a woman . She was a girl , and she was crying . I stopped and looked her in the eyes . `` Are you okay ? '' she asked . I asked her , `` Are we going to be okay ? I do . '' She looked at my face , and tears started to well up in her eyes . She said , I do , and so I ran . The man with the suit walked out of my house , with me following .\": '3 1 0 1 2', \"Dear Mr. P. I know that you are in the middle of writing this letter .

I turned , sprinting hard towards it and running in . The Arcanine sniffed at the entrance , but walked away . I breathed out a sigh of relief , opening my bag and pulling out a bottle of water . I sipped from it , when I heard a noise from somewhere in the cave . I froze , and looked around . In the corner was a small , shivering figure . I pulled a small , worn dagger out of my bag . It was blunt and rusted , but if I was in danger ... As I approached the figure , it lifted it 's head . It was a young trainer . He inched back into the corner , sobbing . `` Do n't hurt me ... .

I noticed that his shoes were barely held together , and his clothes were torn and dirty . He looked at my bag . `` M-may I have some food , if you have any ? '' He asked , averting his eyes . I pulled a strip of beef jerky out of my bag , along with a water bottle . I handed them to him , and he ate the food quickly , drinking water in between bites . He smiled , thanking me .

Its floor a peeling green on concrete with fake wood trim covering the walls . They sit on high stools and stare at each other while a large cup sits on the table . Behind them , classical music plays through an ipad . An alarm on the ipad goes off , showing the alarm notification for 4am . Tommy reaches over to silence it , but leaves the Blue Danube Waltz to play on . Jenny looks around the room at everyone as she reaches for the cup . Its lukewarm kool-aid sloshing as she lifts it to her mouth . She tastes it a little and hesitates . One big gulp later , she gives a big smile now- stained red with the drink , looks at everyone in the room , and carefully puts it down . A moment later her eyes close and she falls off her chair . Sarah reaches over , feels for a pulse , and makes a knife-across-the-throat motion to Tommy and Lenny . Sarah pets Jenny 's cheek for a moment and uses the tips of her index finger to close Jenny 's blank and staring-into-space eyes . Tommy snaps up quickly knocking his chair over , opens his mouth about to say something , but quickly snaps his mouth shut , his teeth making a snapping noise , and screams right before taking a big gulp . He stands , bewildered for a moment , and falls over . Sarah is biting her fist and refuses to look at his body . Lenny just stares off into space but his eyes dart to Tommy 's still body for a moment . Tommy is sprawled into an exaggerated motion , his arms and legs sticking out in an almost comedic fashion . He twitches a little and then stops . Sarah does n't bother to check his body . She nods at Lenny and her eyes begin to tear up . Lenny puts his finger to her lips and makes a knowing look . He kisses her forehead . Lenny reaches for the cup , but Sarah stops him . They half-heartedly wrestle for the cup but Lenny gives up to Sarah as she silently mouths `` please . '' He looks down at the grain and scratches on the surface of the table for a moment . Sarah stares at the cup in her hands for a good 30 seconds . Lenny watches as she drinks it , knocking her head back in a big gulp , like how children swallow pills . His fingers tap on the wooden table louder and louder . Sarah makes one drowsy motion with her hand , trying to communicate something , but she falls over before finishing . Lenny stops tapping his fingers and stares at her body for a minute . Lenny sits for a moment staring at the cup , then the wood grain , then running his fingers over the grain then briefly touching the cup . He looks at his three dead friends , stands , and knocks the cup on the floor , spilling the poison kool-aid onto the lime green concrete floor . He looks at the red spill in a sea of green , pauses , and spits on it . He then carefully arranges the bodies in a neat row while fixing their clothes and hair as much as possible as tears run down his face . He holds each persons hand just for a few seconds each . He feels the back of their hands with his thumb , rubbing hard over the cooling skin , over and over . Finally he makes them all hold hands and face each other . He then picks up the prepared letter with all their signatures- including his own , examines the signatures for a moment , crumples it , and puts it in his front pocket . He gets into his car and drives to the police station as the radio blares some pop song , walks up to the the first person he sees , and hands the police officer the crumpled note . She looks at him quizzically for a moment , unfolds the note , reads it , and yells `` We need an ambulance at 442 Maple now '' as Lenny sits down in a chair and holds his head in his hands .\": '5 5 4 5 5', \"`` Spot the difference ?

Music made me feel complete as I let the notes flow from my mind down my tingling nerves that felt as if they were on fire before hitting my fingers re creating that beautiful melody like ive heard all this time ! ( continuing at 10:09pm est . IM BACK . and suggestions welcome ) I could feel the beat pounding through me in beat to my heartbeat as if I was the beat ... I could feel it pounding through me ... Uh ho . I think I pissed off my old neighbors ... .The old farts probably hate this music ... .Wait ... .Are those gang signs ? No they 're too old to be in a gang ... Is that this music sign that ive seen in pictures ? Eh they seem to enjoy the music as one has some form of a electric guitar..Cant tell what it is though ... Old timer : `` Damn son , I 've not heard a tune like that since way back in the day in '44 ( 2044. Who says old people cant enjoy music ? ) I 'm just glad I still have my old acoustic ! but enough chit chat . Lets roll thunder boy. ! '' `` As you say sir ! After you ! '' I say snapping a quick mock salute at him jokingly as he himself starts playing were I left off ... .Damn he 's good . Probably one of the last true guitarists out there back before this skill set crap . Good lord that sounds amazing ! and it sounds even better coming from his guitar ! Where has this been all my life ? `` This is amazing ! I can feel the beat pound in my chest ! '' I belt out at the old timer gleefully as I struggle to keep up with his old but surprisingly fast fingers `` This is the REAL American music genre boy ! Rock 'n ' Roll ! The good stuff ! Listen and learn it boy '' The neighbor says before he breaks off into the Solo and my god it is perfect ... Perfectly in tune to the song perfectly in beat and just ... .Complete ... .I have never felt this complete or whole in all my life ... I wish I had done this sooner . If only I had listened to my father before I lost my time but this is too beautiful to dread on that for long ! Oh god that riff ( whammy ? ) was DELICIOUS ! But sadly all things come to a end ... .As he reached the end of the solo I stood there mouth agape at how good he was . `` Sir ... H how 're you so good at that ? May I know ? '' I tentatively ask . `` Boy theres a lot no one knows about all of us old timers ... '' He says with a huge smile plastered on his face looking like someone wiped twenty years from his face `` The reason young man ? I was a veteran ... And part of a band back in the day . Lots of free time and boredom ... .Hence why I wear this Airbourne tattoo ... For my brethren and band . We were the last rock n roll band before most left or disbanded or passed away '' `` Well ... I dont know what to say sir ... Im honored to have played with a past guitarist from when bands were common as opposed to now .

Looking at what was probably his equivalent of puss ooze from his eyes , I figured I 'd indulge him . `` Simple , our factory farms , while being wonderful for food production , are also perfect biological weapons factories . I simply had everyone take off their masks , and put on a good face . You just assumed that it was safe .

The first two that I 'd met came to my home , demanding that I take them to our leader , that our planet was to be annexed to a being named Frieza . Too bad they took those celebratory drinks . And joined in that hookah . I 'd hoped that they 'd drink and smoke themselves into a stupor but apparently THC is super nerve gas where they 're from because they were dead in seconds . The military showed up a few minutes later , somewhat shocked at how I managed to kill two aliens in two hours . To be fair , the one they encountered took half that many minutes to subdue and that was because apparently the president carries a can of mace . I still ca n't believe that bullets do n't work on them , but the universe is full of strange things . This was n't the end though , we 'd already started making working replicas of all their tech . One of the prototype reactors had actually outperformed the one that NASA built it from . Then they used it to test an RKM . Funny , we thought that the 1507 kg projectile going .9999 C would n't go through Charon but it blew up Pluto too .

Sent out to die because some asshole I did n't even vote for ca n't keep his mouth shut . Sure , the first couple nights were tense , but since then we 've treated it as a vacation . Storytelling by the fire , and a lot of booze . I filled the glasses and hobbled on over to him . `` Walking a bit better ?

Luckily for me Eugene just laughed . `` It 's fine , my foot could n't be saved . Besides , it means once we get out of here I get to go home , they 'll probably toss your ass back on the front lines . '' He took another big drink . `` You know it 's funny . We 're a different race , we have different religions , and we come from a world apart , but none of that seems to matter . when we sit down and share a drink . '' I sat next to Eugene . `` Damn right . Do n't care what you look like , who you pray to , or who you follow as long as you can make a good drink ! '' His glass is almost empty now , man this guy can drink . `` Men can be weird like that . Gods ca n't get in the way of a friendship , but a pretty girl can . '' Eugene gave me puzzled look as I slid the knife into his side . `` I know she chose you , but I want her . '' Tears welled up in Eugene 's eyes , but he did n't make a sound as he slumped over .

I ca't tell if she 's trying to be cute or if she knows I 's not . `` Yeah , I suppose they are . '' It 's hard to tell . I do know that they 'll be alive , but they 've never been alive . `` Are you sure you 're ready ? '' she asks , and she 'll probably have to be . `` Yes . '' A little too loud . `` We 'll see .

A couple of jocks - prime Barbarian material in their own right - shouted their lines boisterously . The quiet mousy girls whispered theirs . My friend aimed his at teacher 's head and wished .

The people around me were silent . I listened . I waited . I sat down . I watched the people around us . I became a part of them , and they became me . I realized I was doing it for them .

I ca n't do anything . I stand up . The clock reads 8:06 . I walk over to the table , and sit down again . It is 8:02:04 :04 . It feels like I 's sitting on a chair .

Much too crowded to identify the one girl talking back . Thinking back ? I lowered my noise-cancelling headphones and listened for anyone actually talking to me . Nothing . Just kids laughing and parents yelling after them . I re-raised the headphones back into place . The headphones were n't necessary for me to read minds , but it allowed me to distinguish them easier . No external noise penetrated them . It gave me tight control of my ability . I gave a final visual scan of my surroundings . No one stuck out . Hmm , interesting . Ever since I was little I thought I was unique . I knew I was unique in reading minds , absolutely . From finding out where my parents hid my presents to getting answers from professors I was always a step ahead of the curve . Most of the time thoughts were so boring , though . Everybody was the same . Insecurities , ideas of what to eat , and money - I 'd heard it all - hundreds of times over . Just across the pasture a cute girl gazed in my direction .

She 's a freaking mind reader . `` Yeah , I guess . '' I was n't proud of the fact , but it was true . Reese Witherspoon is a delight . `` Wait a minute ! '' I exclaimed .

She looked like she was wearing a black dress , with a pink dress shirt and a blue dress pants , and was holding a baby in her arms . She smiled at me . She started to cry . I watched her as she threw her arms around me and cried . I saw her crying so hard I felt like I was crying too . She pulled me to my feet , and started crying . She held me close , and we cried together . I closed my eyes , but she kept crying . I realized that I had no idea what to say , and that I needed a new direction . I found myself crying again .

Who are you ? Why are you at my house ? ” I asked . She gave a soft snort . “ Not this , again. ” She reached up and softly touched my forehead . My house started to shimmer in the night air , eventually disappearing altogether . We were standing on cool sand dunes that stretched as far as the eye could see .

In his optimistic moments he thought it was just the abuse talking , but Harold had always been more of a pessimist . He knew he was just like her , he was so full of hate and anger , with a temper that was as violent as it was unpredictable . There was only one real way to break the cycle . School had been a place of misery , he couldn ’ t help but get into fights . He did n't fit in , and was always on the outside , his rage would leak out on the few unfortunate children who had taken the bullying too far .

They ’ d quote statistics that strongly correlated “ age at sight development ” with all sorts of positive life developments , they didn ’ t mention the statistics for the late bloomers , but the worst was always implied . And of course the first thing you ’ d hear from a kid once they could see was the long list of things blind people had never done . There had never been a blind , president or Senator . None of the famous sport stars were blind , and none of truly famous and loved Actors had ever been blind . There had of course been a few successful scientist that has made it through the various blind purges in history , and others that had made their mark , but there had always been an unspoken ugliness that followed these people , a scar on their legacy unfaded by the generations .

In highschool he was at least one of many , in college he was one of few . As an adult being blind was something to stay away from , a sign of human malfunction . Nobody ever asked if it had been a choice , a fear that kept him blind , everyone just assumed it wasn ’ t .

The sounds , oh the sounds ; I still hear them in my memories , sometimes , their intensity and pure joy . I would dance in the light , dance to the sounds , and dance for the gods . They would smile upon me , and I would often find food after I performed . I pleased them , and in their benevolence I was blessed . If others of my species came near my territory , I would do my best to selfishly scare them away , wanting to keep the gods ' favor for myself ; I wish I had n't , as it 's so terribly lonely in the darkness . As time passed , I noticed that the light would come less and less . There were fewer smiles , and it seemed as though many of the gods had forgotten me , leaving one who did n't care about me as much as she had before . I would move for her , finally resigning myself to using the hours of daylight to simply searching for her attention once more . The night grew even longer , seeming to last for days , and food became scarce . I could hear the noises , but where they were once so joyful , they had become flatter and farther away . It 's almost always night , now . The heat , once released during the daylight , has become unbearable . The waterfalls , once a place to frolic with glee , are now sometimes painful . Sometimes , I get a few hours of brightness to dance for my god , though I think she turns from me almost as soon as she looks . It 's not hard to ignore me , for I am small and I 'm sure they have greater things to which they must attend , but what I would n't give for them to just prove to me that I mean something .

Did you just prompt on my favorite game series ever ? Well then ... > *Blue Moon ... You knew just what I was there for ... You heard me saying a prayer for ... someone I really could care for ... * The man with glasses and a hole in his head walked into the Tops casino and scanned the room . No sign of Benny yet . The tables were full of gamblers , diners and drinkers in various sates of mind . Sober , drunk , poor , rich , winners , losers . Thinking he 'd just need to wait for a couple of hours for Benny to show up , the spectacled mind decided to grab a drink . One of the patrons caught his eye . He was standing at the bar , nursing a whisky , and was wearing a Vault suit with various bits of metal welded to it as crude armor . He was conspicuously unarmed , like all the patrons , but the man 's expert eyes could make out the outline of a laser pistol hidden under his suit , mirroring his own 9mm in a hidden pocket of his duster . More importantly , the vault-suited man had a Pip-boy , like his own . Now that 's something you do n't see that often in the wastes . Deciding he 'd try and learn more , the spectacled man waved the waitress over for a whisky and went to stand at the bar next to the vault-suited patron . Seeing his new drinking buddy , Vault-Man turned to him with a genuine smile . `` Howdy , pardner '' , he said . `` I think that 's what you 're supposed to say in these parts . At least , that 's what that one-wheeled cowboy robot said ... '' `` Victor ? You 've met Victor ? `` Of course . Nobody who 's interesting can make it through the Mojave Wasteland without running into that delusional bag of bolts . And you look like someone interesting too . Where 'd you come from ? '' *I could n't feel any better , or I 'd be saaaaaaaaad* That was a question he 'd heard before . The answer was clear . `` The grave . You ? '' `` I could say the same . A bigger grave than yours I 'm sure , but a grave nonetheless . Who are you , then , to cheat death like it ai n't nothing ? '' `` I am ... was ... am a courier with the Mojave Express , nothing more . '' `` Ah , a Courier . I 've met another one of you on my way west . He was somethin ' . Strange detail I remember , though , he had an Old World flag on his duster ... That ring a bell ? '' `` No . '' Something had made the Courier 's skin crawl though . `` Your way west ? You come from the east then ? You with the Legion ? '' *Why do n't you do right , like some other men do ? * `` Nah , I 'm not with them . I come from farther out east , where the Legion would actually be considered progress . I did cross their territory on my way here though . '' `` You crossed Legion territory ? Alone ? '' `` Man , I come from a place where bombs from the Great War still litter the ground . The only human beings you see are either coked-out assholes like them Fiends you got there , or are destined to be enslaved , raped or eaten , not necessarily in that order . The only other people you have are nutjob power-armored zealots fighting endless armies of Super Mutants like those that have your NCR shitting themselves in the hills . I made my way through all that to get out of there . Trust me , a bunch of jumped-up tribals like the Legion were n't gon na stop me . '' The Courier was n't about to dispute that . The fire in Vault Man 's eyes was proof enough that he could , and did , do exactly what he said . It was a fire the Courier knew all too well , the kind that could drive a man to gut a Deathclaw with a rusty Ripper if it came to that . `` Anyway '' , continued Vault Man , `` what brings you out here , friend ? '' `` Unfinished business . '' `` Ah , if I had a cap everytime I heard that one ... Last guy who had unfinished business to settle was a man set on fire and thrown in a canyon . You do n't have anything like that , do you ? '' `` Not so bad . But a guy did shoot me in the head , some time ago . That 's what I 'm here for . He owns this place . '' *In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red ... Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead ... * `` What ? Your mark runs with the Chairmen ? Man , you must really want him , to run into their den like it 's nothing ... '' `` Not like it 's nothing . I do n't have a plan , I 'm making it all up as I go along . Last time I did that ... Well , last time I did that , I negotiated a hostage situation with some Great Khans , but I 'm dealing with bigger fish now . '' At that moment , the elevator doors opened and Benny walked in . The Courier had almost drawn his gun and started shooting , when he realised Benny was n't alone . Four armed guards trailed him close , SMGs at the ready . How like the chief of the Chairmen to stack the odds in his favor . The Courier turned towards Vault-Man . `` Hey , listen , you look like you can handle yourself . Wan na tag along with me for a while ? I can use the extra firepower , and there 's a bunch of caps and an introduction to Mr. House in it for you '' `` Hah , keep your caps , I 've got more money than I can spend anyway . I 've got nothing better to do though , and you look like a guy who gets in trouble often . I like trouble . And meeting Mr. House is a pretty good deal sweetener . '' `` Great .

While the floor area didn ’ t live up to the hype inspired by our guide , this was more than made up for in height – thin ledges lining the walls were spaced out seemingly eternally above us , each providing access to eight doors . The floor was made of terrazzo , with a simple rectangular platform embedded in the center of the room . I guessed this was for the guide ’ s use in navigating the archives . Against the wall were eight bare platforms aligned with the upper level ’ s doors . One for each of us . Our guide stood in the center and spoke . He was tall and wore a mask and a black robe . The man was rather unremarkable , like the rest of this place ( excluding the eternally high ceiling ) , but he somehow demanded more attention than anyone I had ever met . His dialect was painfully enunciated but his speech was plain , and like everything else he said up to this point , it was repeated in Spanish and two other languages for the four of us who didn ’ t speak English . As instructed , we all moved to stand by our platforms . I was on the side of the entry opposite the side the guide started on . I would be last , but I didn ’ t wait long – the guide spent the next thirty or so minutes giving individual attention to my peers , bequeathing them various items and quietly discussing… whatever . The first lady got an old glass bottle . One man received a ring , and a spear was the one weapon was given out ( loudly identified by the enthusiast among us as Gungnir . He was crushed when his platform revealed a pair of leather shoes ) . It seemed the guide was a bit more excited than usual in his stride over to me . He put his hand on my shoulder as we watched the platform change shape to reveal my gift : a crystal-looking object with five facets on the top and bottom forming pyramidal shapes , connected in the middle to form the rough shape of a pointed AA battery . Throughout the crystal , the interior was a flat gray color . “ This item is one of eight housed on the second floor of the archives . It is the only one that has never been claimed . Some of these items played significant roles in forming the universe you live in today – others were hardly significant , at least in the hands of those that obtained them . Even in those cases , I was still able to discern the true purpose of every item – except this one . I have no idea what this is . Do you ? ” I told him I didn ’ t . Of course , that was a lie . I recognized it immediately , and my heart was pounding . I had seen it in my dreams for years . He knew , but he didn ’ t press me , and soon enough I was out of the archives and back home .

The Jedi are analogous to medieval knights or samurai , with very passive moral and ethical codes , similar to Buddhist monks . They are spread throughout the galaxy loyally working for various sovereign states and leaders , but some are also private contractors working for themselves . The Jedi are not celibate , and are actively pursuing the continuation of a force sensitive bloodline . This could be an important theme throughout the films , the Jedi are worried about how to continue their kind , and how to properly train their children etc ... Obi-Wan is the main protagonist of the films . It starts with Obi-Wan completing his training alone with Yoda , they could be discussing their worries about the future of the Jedi . Then it focusses on Obi-Wan becoming a teaching figure and finding Anakin , who could be a street-rat sort of character , misbehaving but insanely talented . In the context of panic about the future of the Jedi , Obi-Wan wants to train Anakin . Obi-Wan also finds and trains some other promising Jedi , including a female character who becomes romantically involved with Anakin , and later gives birth to Luke and Leia . Obi-Wan should be only slightly older than Anakin . The films focus on their characters and their relationship from the start and actually establish their friendship . Cue epic force and lightsaber training scenes with some Yoda in the mix , fun adventures together etc ... From there you can simultaneously establish Palpatine 's character as another older Jedi , frustrated with the current obedience and ethics of the Jedi , who remain faithful to their respective realms . He believes that due to their power and skill , the Jedi should group together and rise up to rule . Palpatine has met Obi-Wan and Yoda a couple of times , and he meets Anakin once while visiting them . While doing his own work , he somehow stumbles upon an ancient Sith manuscript or force sensitive object , and teaches himself the ways of the dark side , becoming very powerful . Palpatine tries to convince other Jedi to join his cause , and he kills any of the Jedi who do n't accept . The Jedi are too morally sound and passive to join him , and they do not have a lust for power being satisfied with their simple , understated lives . However , he manages to get through to Anakin , who is still being trained by Obi-Wan and is not a mature Jedi yet . Obi-Wan and the female Jedi character fail to convince Anakin to come back to the light side . Anakin defeats Obi-Wan in battle and is about to kill him , but is saved by the female Jedi student . Anakin sees this as a betrayal and kills her ( obviously this is all happening after the birth of their children ) . Obi-Wan , injured but still alive , hides Luke and Leia . Leia mentions in A New Hope that Obi-Wan fought with her father in the Clone Wars , so Obi-Wan was a Jedi working for her adoptive father , and the Clone Wars were some smaller scale interplanetary war between Alderaan and some other nearby planets that Obi-Wan had been a spy or warrior in . He searches for and finds an apathetic and defeated Yoda who has gone into hiding , lost all hope now that the other Jedi have been murdered . Yoda essentially cuts the cord with Obi-Wan and convinces him that the best thing to do is to go live out the rest of his days in peace away from the Empire 's grip .

It 's processes lagged . It 's monitor was dim . I dusted its buttons off every single day , but a few hours later , it would just come back , as if I had never even been there . I knew it was inevitable-The ATM was dying . `` Fear not , my son . '' ATM said . `` We knew this day was coming , ever since you were a boy . Now here is your final payment . '' The ATM spat out $ 70,000 as its screen slowly faded to black . I could n't suppress the tears rolling down my face . I looked up to face the decrepit ATM . I had never known my parents . I 've been living on the streets for as long as I can remember . When I was seven years old , I joined a local gang . They always asked me to steal from local stores because I had skinny and fast . No one suspected the baby faced seven year old , which made stealing very easy . I had a family , food , and no cares in the world . At the time , it was a good life . I thought I could do this for the rest of my life , what a foolish thought that was . One day I stepped into a grocery store name Paldi 's with an empty stomach and bad judgement . As soon , as I walked in , I was greeted by employee . `` Why , hello there , little boy ! How can I- '' She froze as soon as I made eye contact with her . She said nothing more and quickly walked away . Even as a 7 year old , I should 've noticed how odd that was . But all I know was that I was hungry and the gang was hungry . My gang was full of teenage thugs , pimps and drug dealers . They were very cruel people , but they were always nice to me because I brought them food . I shuddered to think what would happen if I did n't deliver . I was collecting my usual round of Oreos , bread rolls , apples and candy when I saw a group of employees walking following me slowly . Again , this should of tipped me off , but when you ca n't think straight when you 're hungry sometimes . I was close to the exit , completely ignoring the manager and the employees getting angrier and angrier as if their presence should have been enough to make me reconsider my actions-which it should have been . I was pushing the shopping cart out of the door to the boys outside , waiting to collect every morsel of food in that cart . `` Alright , shorty ! '' A large boy called James said happily . `` We 're gon na eat good tonight . '' Another boy called Tom yelled . Suddenly , the boys widened their eyes at something behind me , and ran . A large , hairy hand grabbed my shoulder and lifted me up and turned me around . I was face to face with an angry , tomato faced bald man . `` YOU ZHINK YOU CAN STEAL FROM MOI '' The bald man thundered in a heavy French accent . I almost peed my pants , I had n't noticed the rusty pipe in his left hand . The female employee from before approached me . `` You think you could get away this for long ? '' She sneered . `` My sister warned me about you . '' The man drew his left hand back , winding up the pipe in his wrist . `` TAKE ZHIS ! '' The manager brought his left hand down with such strength , the air seemed to shift . I seriously doubted I would survive a blow like , so I screamed so loud the large man dropped his pipe . I took advantage of that-poking his eyes with my fingers . `` AHHH ! SACRE BLEU '' His hands instinctively rushed to his face , dropping me . I ran as fast as my little legs would carry me that day , but I soon realized that I was n't as fast as I thought I was . The manager quickly recovered and brought his entire gang of employees after me . And they were getting very close . `` I 'm only seven , do n't these dummy whores have anything better to do ? '' I muttered to myself . Yes , I know does n't make sense . My vocabulary at that time consisted of what I learned from middle school dropouts . Anyways , I only managed to stay about four feet ahead of them . I was running out of energy , so I ran into a dark alleyway , hoping that it led to somewhere . It did n't . It was a dead end , and I was completely exhausted . I had decided to except my fate when I heard a clicking noise . I snapped my head in the direction of the noise and say a bright scarlet ATM machine . I had a logo that I did n't recognize , so I went a little closer . As I was walking , something crumpled under my feet . A hundred dollar bill ! `` I 'm sure he went down this way ! '' I heard a female voice say . I dropped the bill and hid next to the ATM . On my way , there were at least 20 more hundred dollar bills on the floor . `` WHERE ARE YOU '' The manager and his gang had reached the end of alley , but I was hidden by the darkness . The manager suddenly looked down and screamed with delight . His employees did the same . Everyone shrieked with delight and started grabbing as much as they can , but the manager yelled at them . `` ARRETES . Give me za money . It will go to za store . '' The manager commanded . All the employees groaned and gave him all the money they collected . The manager grunted in satisfaction , and they all left . I sighed with relief , and I heard a deep voice behind me . `` I saved your life . You are indebted to me . '' I whirled around and saw the ATM 's screen flash to a bright white . The ATM was the one talking to me . `` I will give you money . Money will get you power in this world . Do you want money ? '' I nodded vigorously , too stunned to speak . `` You must never go back to that horrid band of miscreants you were with before , do you understand ? '' The ATM said sharply . I nodded again . I was n't too fund of them after James and Tom had ditched me . `` In ten years , I will die . '' The ATM continued . `` At that time , you will be 17 years old , and a billionaire , if you follow all of my instructions . '' `` Well , what are they ? '' `` I will start you out with 7,000 '' the ATM spat out a plethora of hundred dollar bills . `` Buy an apartment near here . That is your first task . After you do that , you will be receiving $ 70,000 from me every week as payment for your tasks . '' `` Alright . '' I began picking up the money . The ATM made a coughing sound . `` Those boys , '' he started . `` They will come after you and try to harm you . '' Use the rest of the money to buy a submachine gun . A man sells them in this alleyway on Thursday nights-come exactly at 8 or do n't come at all . '' I looked at the ATM in bewilderment . I was only seven , but i knew what he was implying . `` What ? ! ? ! '' I cried . `` I do n't like it either , '' The ATM said calmly . `` But I heard them was they ran past you . They WILL hurt you if they see you again . '' I dropped the money I was carrying and backed away . `` How do I know I can trust you ? '' `` You have no family and no friends . Do you really have many options ? '' The ATM retorted . I knew he was right . I sighed and began picking up the money . '' `` Do n't worry , '' The ATM said . `` This is only a one time thing . But you MUST stay alive for us to complete the mission , and they are a threat to your safety . Do you trust me , will you join me ? '' I stood up , and nodded at the ATM . `` Excellent .

'' Amy stopped her soft petting and stared quizzically at the back of my neck for quite some time before saying `` I 'm pretty sure you did . '' At this point , I was rather baffled . Amy and I have been dating for three years , and suddenly she 's decided to make up some sort of birth mark ? `` Amy , '' I said . `` Would n't I know if I had a birth mark or not ? '' `` Well , yes . I suppose you would . '' `` Then I can guarantee you that I have never had a birth mark . I can also guarantee you that I never will . '' `` Wait , '' she sputtered . `` Take off your shirt . '' `` Really ? I 'm not in the mood right now . '' `` I 'm not trying to have sex with you , just take off your shirt . '' `` Well , **now** I 'm a little disappointed . Fine . '' I took my shirt off . She snatched it out of my hands and threw it on the floor . I spun around to look at her , but she twisted my body back , making me face the mirrored cabinet again . `` What are you doing ? '' I asked . `` Just hold still , '' she replied . God , I loved her accent . There 's something so elegant about Brits that I ca n't seem to get over . `` Ha ! I knew you had a birth mark ! '' She ran her fingers down my spine and stopped a quarter of the way up my back , slightly off to the right . `` See ? '' she said spinning me around so I could look at my back in the cabinet . She was right , I had a rather large , yet faint , birthmark on my back . `` Okay , so what ? I do n't have one on my neck , I was just confused , '' I replied . `` You said you did n't have a birth mark . You lied . '' `` I told you , I was confused . What does it matter , anyway ? It 's just a birth mark . '' She sat in silence for a few moments before I saw her eyes widen . `` Is something wrong ? '' I asked , growing a little more than a little concerned about the condition of my back . What if , I thought , there is some nasty deformity that I had failed to notice . Or cancer . I 've already had a cancerous mole once , I 'm not looking forward to another . `` No . I do n't know . Maybe . '' She was growing more and more panicked -- it was n't obvious , but I could see it in her eyes . `` Is there any reason , '' she continued , `` that you would have a birth mark that says # 2903 ? '' `` 2903 ? '' Then , it hit me . All of the memories came rushing back -- the cancer , the chemo , the doctor telling me I was definitely not going to make it .

It was finally over , the final stone had been placed and the protecter beams had , for the first time , been locked into place . No longer could the darkness of Sodrow seep into the valley , no longer did children have to sleep in their mothers arms to stop the nightmares . This was a day that would never be forgotten . Years had past since it had all started . This was evident from the grey hairs that had started to grow from on Gren 's chin and the stiffness in his back and arms . He turned around and looked at those who had followed him . Through thick and thin they were still by his side , loyal till the end . Frim , Dorg , Wastal , Hadvar and Astrid . Some of greatest friends he 'd ever had . There were others though , ones who had been lost by this everlasting quest . Gren could only hope their souls found peace in the afterlife .

The darkness had faded back to the hell from wence it came and would never return . It was not just the valley that had been saved but Gren himself . Before this all began he was but a lonely tavern regular contemplating suicide every night before he drank himself to sleep . In truth , it was the darkness that had truly saved him . It moulded him into the hero that stands tall today . It was then , in the peaceful sunset , that Gren would finally have to ask himself ...

'' Orville smacked the top of Harold 's head . Harold 's feeble jaw released as he stumbled about a foot backwards . Like a rusted spring , Harold 's octogenarian legs diverted his body back at Orville . Harold slowly raised both hands and moaned at his target through his dentureless mouth . Orville confused the moans as a retaliatory scream . Harold sluggishly made a gravity-assisted lunge at Orville . Thinking on his spry , 86 year old feet , he planted his stance and lifted up his cane , redirecting his zombified friend . Harold tumbled to the ground at a falling balloons pace , landing squarely on his leg . It was his ~~bad~~ worse leg , and after the collision Harold futilely tried to get up . Orville stared , his mind attempting to catch up with the incredible pace of the past two actions . Meanwhile , Harold gummed at the jogging pants armor on Orville 's leg . Orville 's senile appraisal of the situation came back empty . As he usually did when he found himself in these frequent moments of disorientation , he tried to avoid potentially having to answer any questions by ignoring the whole thing and changing the subject . `` Quitting being a goof Harold ! We have to make it to The JC Penny by 9:05 ! Their coupons for this month expire today , so we need to be the first customers to beat the check-out lineups ! '' Harold was unable to get up , but his undead gums continued to suck Orville 's pants like a clogged vacuum . Orville pulled his leg away and Harold moaned an elderly , raspy grumble . The garage entrance to the mall and the side staff entrance were already open , but all the stores remained locked with their cage and plexi-glass security doors . Attracted by Harold 's undead groans , two employees of a nearby clothing store stumbled in the wails direction with their zombie gaits . The first bounced off the display window , setting off a domino-chain of falling mannequins which created an audibly offensive percussion orchestra that echoed throughout the empty mall , attracting more creatures . Out of a nearby washroom came squeaked a mop bucket being pushed by a one-armed pale custodian who had vomit dripping down his mouth and shirt . Close behind was a girl in a hotdog stand uniform , chewing on the custodians severed arm . From the direction Orville and Harold had been walking , a mall security guard was riding in an topless golf cart , but it ’ s rubber tire gripped the wall , riding it all the way past Orville and Harold . Orville looked around . “ Harold , look at this . Now all these snot-nose kids are tinkerin ’ in our buisness . You ’ re 80 ! You don ’ t need a damn nurse yet ! Get up , you baby ! ” He turned to the custodian . “ Don ’ t need no help thanks ! l All Fine ! Tying his shoe ! ^Don ’ t embarass us Harold ! ” As the hot-dog girl and custodian staggered closer and Harold incessantly groaned on the floor Orville began to notice that they weren ’ t coming to help Harold , but were coming straight for himself . “ Hey ! He ’ s the one attacked me ! He ’ s half-Jap , and I have them veterans reflexes. ” Orville clenched his cane as the two got closer . At that moment the security guards buggy hit a sharp corner , which reoriented him in Orvilles direction . Orville saw the guard approaching , and he stepped to the side and he wound up his cane in anticipation . Nine heart-racing seconds later the vehicle was within cane ’ s length and Orville swung at the passing guard . The guard fell off the back , but Orville hooked the steering wheel with the handle of his cane ! It pulled Orville a few inches where he tripped over the ground-flailing Harold and landed miraculously into the drivers position of the vehicle . Orville ’ s mind hadn ’ t caught up to his reflexive instincts and he tried piecing the previous few moments together as he coasted down the mall . “ What was I doi… Oh yeah . The JC Penny. ” Orville checked his watch , 9:02 . *Harold will just have to meet me there , * Orville thought to himself . The front doors of the mall unlocked automatically at 9AM , letting in a sea of zombie shoppers .

I tried to think about something else as he ranted on . 5 years ago , everyone had voted . There was too much violence , too much division ... The only thing we all knew for certain was our world would forever be on a doomed path of war and resentment , unless a drastic change was made . The silent majority rose up to change the future and decided on another way , the Agreement . Another drunk patron whose number I could n't see had caught on to 817 's complaints and made his way over . `` I misss art , '' he slurred at us . Through secret means one person had been selected , after which everyone else would then be patterned . We became Like-Minded . Disagreement had become treason . I could hear the exchange getting more heated in the background . We know better than this , so I tried to diffuse the situation . `` We still have art- '' `` New art ! '' Our new friend interjected . `` None of us can draw . Or paint . I 'm worthless . I just thought it would be different ... I had hopes ...

We are the same terrible loser now .

They were falling out of alignment . I had already begun to gather my things and prepare to get away when 817 caught on to what I was doing . His eyes flared at my wildly ; he looked around and realized he was going too far . He should have stopped there , but did n't . The drunk stranger even knew better , as he silently slumped back to the other side of the bar . He was shouting now . `` Who are we ? What asshole did they use to make the template ? The one that made us all the same ? Where is the fucking lazy , prideful , jealous , emotional wreck who they left the world to ? Even when we all agree we still ca n't get anything right !

It was the first thing we all agreed on . We do n't like to dwell on things , so within moments he bar has resumed the drunken murmur that normally filled its walls .

The door opened , and a large man in a black suit walked out , and he spoke . `` Hi , I 'd like to talk to you . I have seen you around , '' said the man . `` We 're dragons , '' replied the dragon , and turned around . `` But we do n't talk to each other .

You 'll learn a lot about me . You will learn about the world , and how we are the only ones that can help you.

Come on . * Finally , my phone rang again . I breathed a sigh of relief as I saw that it was indeed a FaceTime request from Mo 's number . I hit ACCEPT , and Mo 's face appeared on my screen . `` Hi ! '' she exclaimed . Her brown eyes shifted back and forth quickly , and her short hair was a mess of tangled clumps . There were wrinkles at the edges of her lips , and dark circles underneath her eyes . She reminded me of a rabid animal . `` Here you go ! Take a look ! '' She held the phone away from her and spun around in a slow circle . `` Is n't it amazing ? '' `` It is , '' I agreed , scrutinizing the view as best as I could .

Why are we so damn hairy ? ” Dr. Grayson sputtered a bit . He ’ d carefully prepared notes that would accurately convey the biochemical changes that had stricken humanity in the past week while still being understandable to the layperson . As of right now , that was primarily this idiot general . After gathering his thoughts for a moment , pausing for several seconds just to spite the general , Dr. Grayson continued , “ First off General Douglas , it ’ s not really hair . Here , take this. ” Dr. Grayson handed the general a small propane torch off his work station . He pointed at the general ’ s arm , “ Light the torch and point it at your arm. ” A flicker of rage flashed across the general ’ s face , “ If this is some sort of joke I ’ ll have your- “ “ It ’ s quite safe . I assure you . I 've done it several times already , ” said Dr. Grayson , cutting off the general . Still glowering , the general sparked the torch and quickly passed it over his arm . Nothing happened . No smoke , no sulfur stench , nothing . The general passed the torch over his arm again , going a bit slower this time . Still , nothing happened . He held the torch over one spot on his left forearm . He held it there a full thirty seconds before turning off the torch and handing it back to the doctor . “ It is n't even warm , ” said the general , shock at the edge of his voice . Dr. Grayson took the torch , “ Yes , I noticed that last week when I spilled a cup of fresh coffee on myself . You see , it ’ s not really hair . It ’ s some sort of carbon nanotube structure , about four hundred nanometers in diameter , packed with some sort of protein that can transduce thermal energy . '' `` The protein converts infrared radiation into electrical potential that ’ s stored between the individual strands . Just FYI , careful when you leave the room , you ’ re going to get a hell of a shock when you touch the metal doorknob , ” said the doctor with a small smirk , and then continued , “ Also , something you , or really anyone of the belligerent persuasion , may find interesting is that the stuff weaves together if you don ’ t brush it . Looks matted and gross as hell , but I think it ’ ll behave a lot like Kevlar . You could be stopping bullets with your chest hair right now. ” The general ignored Dr. Grayson , instead studying his shaggy arm hair , but after a moment he came out of it . “ What about the other enhancements ? ” he asked . “ I was getting to that before your question , ” said Dr. Grayson , taking a subtle dig at the general , “ The enhancements , as you call them , are , on the hole , beneficial in almost every way but one . The enhanced strength appears to come from an enhanced form of the myosin protein . Nothing too exotic , I ’ m sure evolution could have cooked this up , but not in a week. ” Dr. Grayson took a seat on his lab bench , “ The eye sight and hearing are the same story , basically upgraded versions of proteins that already existed , '' he said , `` Couple changes to the digestive tract , they seem to bolster our ability to absorb nutrients into our gut wall . We 've also seen an explosion in gut microbes . It ’ s entirely possible we 've gained the ability to digest cellulose. ” “ Meaning ? ” asked the general . “ We could probably start eating grass if we wanted , ” replied Dr. Grayson , “ though I don ’ t think there 've been any changes to help the taste. ” The general nodded , “ You mentioned a change that was n't beneficial ? ” Dr. Grayson shrugged , “ It ’ s not a change so much as a consequence of the ones we 've already seen . You see , these changes make our bodies far more robust , but it comes at a nutritional cost . Whereas before we would be looking at one to three thousand calories a day , we ’ re now looking at around nine to twelve thousand . It may not affect us here in the first world , but where people are already starving… ” the doctor shrugged again , “ things could get pretty bad , or worse , I should say. ” The general nodded yet again , and then began to pace for a bit . Dr. Grayson watched him , wondering if the meeting was at an end . He ’ d have left , but it was his lab , when the general turned back to him , “ I have to say Dr. Grayson , I ’ m extremely impressed with your work . You 've accomplished more in a week than any of the other teams working on the recent changes , so I ’ m going to bump you up a security clearance and bring you on full time . We ’ ll be leaving for a CIA black site in an hour . We ’ ll send someone to pick you up , and get you somewhere safe , ” the general turned to leave . Dr. Grayson nearly fell off the stool jumping to follow the general , “ WOAH ! Hold up there , general ! What do you mean leave ? I ’ m heavily invested here ! ” The doctor stopped in his tracks with a sudden realization . He then called after the general , “ What do you mean ‘ safe ’ ! ? ” he started running again out into the hall after the general . The general turned back , letting the doctor catch up . Quietly , he said , “ We 've found something . Something out near the orbit of Mars , and it is coming here , ” the general fixed the doctor with his cold gaze , “ We 've found ourselves with a lot of questions this week , and so far you ’ re the only one to give us any answers. ” The general began to walk towards the building ’ s exit again , “ If that does n't make you one of the best of us , I don ’ t know what does .

You walk to the same old lady at the canteen , absent-mindedly handing her the exact amount for your standard daily breakfast . You skirt round the same building every morning to get to where you need to be . You grunt in acknowledgement when your wife tells you about her day . We lived in an apartment on the thirty-seventh floor . The air was breezy and the view was great . We had no children , but we were happy just the way it was . Until we weren ’ t . The old lady at the canteen passed away six months ago . When you heard the news from her co-worker , you must have felt something . But you were in a rush and hastily handed your money over , as usual . Different person , same routine . All of a sudden , someone you saw almost daily was no longer there . But she was just a stranger , right ? Life goes on . The building was cordoned off , having been designated for demolition . You realized only then , that it was an old apartment building just like yours . In the days leading up to its end , it became a nest for rats and addicts . Sometimes you would see them in the mornings , too high to leave . The adjacent building was being designated for preservation . Construction was ongoing for a plaque that would declare if the last mayor or the local Olympic medalist had once lived there . As you rode the elevator up , you wondered what this building would be like in a century : celebrated or shunned . Well , you weren ’ t going to be around to find out . She wanted a divorce . The floors slid down and down again in the glass panel . The lift brings you higher and higher still , distant from the bustle of the streets on a Monday morning . That day , you didn ’ t get to see the old lady ’ s younger co-worker . You never even got to find out either of their names . You didn ’ t skirt round the cordon of the old apartment building that had addicts , or check if the actual plaque has finally replaced its temporary wooden counterpart . Today , the floors just kept sliding past . Perhaps you have been attentive for the first time in a long time . Perhaps it was the guilt of so many missed opportunities that were weighing you down so much that the lift was struggling . Perhaps time always stretches when one ’ s life is coming to an end . She had flown away to stay with her parents . That was your last missed opportunity . The floors slid on and on and you had the wild thought that perhaps you were going to crash through the roof . What was it that finally caused things to break down ? Was it miscommunication or the snapping of the final shred of tolerance ? Was it the time when you forgot the anniversary or the time she didn ’ t get a response to “ Do I look fat in this ? ” When was the last time you truly fought for her ? The floors slid on . Something was definitely wrong here . You thought you had given it your all with her , especially in the last couple of weeks . But is there something else to be done ? You repeatedly pressed the “ R ” button impatiently . What was wrong with this lift ? But there *was* something else to be done . You have fought for her , but never totally letting down your guard , never totally putting yourself out there for her to rip to shreds if she so chose . The elevator chimed *ding* . The doors slid open . You look at the LED panel , and realized that it was thirty-seventh floor although you were single-mindedly heading for the roof . You were exactly where you needed to be . You ran out of the longest elevator ride and to your apartment . Your passport was in that drawer in your room , in the home that belonged to both of you .': '5 5 5 4 3', \"`` You 're not going to believe this , but you are !

I felt the sword shoot out of the ground , and then I felt it hit the ground again . It hit the floor , and my eyes widened . I watched the sword fly off the floor and out of existence . I grabbed the sword from the ground and threw it at the wall . I stood up , and ran towards the door . I jumped up , but the sword was gone , and that is when I heard it . The sound of the sword striking the ground was deafening . I dropped the sword as it hit , and felt it 's force pull me into the room . I tried to run , but my legs were weak . I fell to the ground as I felt my body being pulled into the dark room . The door slammed shut , and there was nothing . There was nothing in the room that I could see . I lay on the dirt , and was surprised to see the sword sitting on a table . It looked like it was holding a sword , but there was naught in it . No one else was there . There were no other weapons in the hall that I saw . I opened the door to the Hall of the Dead , and found a man , and his sword . He was a tall , dark man , with a long beard , and dark eyes . He looked at me , and said , `` I am not here to kill you , but to be the one to save you . '' I looked down at the sword on the table , and thought , `` It is my duty to be your savior .

Would n't my life be more achieving if I just did what I told myself I was going to do ? Easier said then done I suppose . A knock came from the other side of my door while I was reciting my typical Thursday night of doing nothing more than playing video games and being lazy . The brief sound made me jump from my seat . I was n't used to getting any visitors at anytime , let alone this time of the night . Convinced my mind was just playing tricks on me I switched my attention back to my TV . Another knock , another sudden turn of my head towards the entrance . This time it was real . I trembled to my feet and cautiously walked towards the door . All sorts of possibilities of what will happen next racing through my head . `` Who 's ... who 's there ? '' my eerie voice gave away my vulnerability . `` You .

My jaw dropped as had no idea how to go forth with this situation . We shared a brief moment of silence before curiosity got the best me . In a cautious tone I opened the door only to see my eyes staring right back at me . I was staring a reflection , a perfect resembling duplicate of myself . As if I was staring at a mirror . He was smiling at me like he knew exactly what my face would look like when I saw him . We maintained eye contact with each other for a long and awkward time and shared the silence of the night outside . `` Hello Harry . '' The man said . I was convinced what I was seeing was not real . That this surreal and enigmatic moment was not happening . My eyes were questioning all of the logical knowledge that I had accumulated throughout the years . Perhaps my sense of feel would bring me back to reality . With a shaky hand and still sharing eye contact , I patted the mans right shoulder and examined it . The man who claims was me was as real as the sun in the sky , or birds singing in a park . `` I 've come to take over Harry . '' The man cautioned .\": '5 4 5 4 3', \"The writer picked up his old Moleskine journal , it ’ s binding coming undone and the back cover hanging off . He had recently been going through his old stuff from his high school days , looking for things to throw away to make room for new things . He took a deep breath , preparing himself for the worst , sat down at his desk , and opened the journal . Sloppy , smeared handwriting greeted him inside . Line after line of his nearly indecipherable scrawling text . Dialogue , setting , paragraphs . He looked over it with pangs of nostalgia , and just a touch of embarrassment . This was some of his early work . And it was absolutely horrible . But it was his , so he kept it . All these years , in the back of his closet , waiting for him . He flipped through the pages , remembering what it was like to write all this out , sitting on his bed in his old family home . He was so young back then . So naïve . He read through everything he had written , slogged through the awkward love scenes between the main character he based on himself and the female character he based on his then girlfriend . Their messy breakup was one of the main reasons he stopped writing this story . He learned a lesson then . Never base characters completely off of people you know . He got to the end , and being a sentimental sap , wrote a note on the page where he left off . I ’ m sorry to do this to you . I really am . You know how much effort I put into this . You were there , every step of the way . I thought about your story every day , and I was really excited about it . But I had no idea what I was doing back then . I just rushed into this , having no plans about where the plot was going , not even knowing what the plot was in the first place . It was a rookie effort at best . But I ’ ve gotten better . I ’ ve started a new project , one that actually has a plot . It ’ s going to be a long haul , but I think it ’ ll make it big . So thank you , for being my first big failure . Because without you , I never would have gotten to where I am now . -M He put down his pen and smiled . He was closing the book , when something caught his eye on the last page . He opened it back up to reveal that a message was appearing below the one he had just written . A rookie effort ? Your first big failure ? That ’ s all we are to you ? Is that really what you think ? You created us , and now you toss us aside like garbage . You never cared about us . And now you ’ re going to throw us away . -D Startled , the writer sat there for a while , looking at the note that had been written . The handwriting wasn ’ t his , not even close , so it couldn ’ t have been something that he had written and somehow hadn ’ t seen . Besides that , he told himself , this is clearly referencing what I just wrote . He decided to write back , see if there was another response . Maybe his mind was just playing tricks on him . He picked his pen back up and began to write again . I said I was sorry . I am sorry . But I couldn ’ t continue with this story after the breakup , you know that . There was too much in here based on Emily , and after we split , I couldn ’ t bring myself to continue writing about her . -M Well maybe you should 've thought of that before you started writing about us . You took a huge risk , and it did n't pay off , and you just blew us off when it became “ too hard ” for you . You 're selfish . You 're weak . You 're a terrible writer . -D The writer sighed and rubbed his eyes , growing tired of this back and forth with someone who 's stuck in the mindset of a high school freshman . Alright , look . I understand where you 're coming from and what you 're thinking . I created you . And I know you feel abandoned , because you think you 're all alone . You think nbody really understands you . You think you 're the only one who really “ gets it ” . But heads up ; you 're not . There are people out there who could understand you , who could help you , but you do n't reach out to them because you hold your standards too high . And now you 're alone . Not because of me , but because of you . You made yourself alone . And now your time is up . Goodbye . -M The writer signed his initial , closed the journal , and leaned back from his desk . He sat there for a while , staring at the journal . After a while , he stood up , took the journal off of his desk , and walked into his kitchen . He rummaged around in his kitchen drawers until he found what he was looking for ; a book of matches . He took the matches and the journal and walked to his back door . He stepped outside , into the warm summer evening air . The sun was setting , and the wind was still . Perfect night for a little fire , the writer thought to himself . He placed the journal on the ground , and opened it up to a blank page . He struck a match , and dropped it onto the open pages of the journal . It did n't take long for it to ignite , and soon it was burning nicely , the fire crackling and smoking . The writer smiled to himself , and looked into the sunset . He stood there like that until the sun went all the way down below the mountains , and then looked down at what remained of the journal . There was a scorched area of his stone patio , but he did n't mind too much . The journal was a pile of ashes now , smoldering weakly . He stamped them out with his foot , leaving nothing burning The writer thought to himself that it was oddly poetic , what he had done . He ’ d destroyed his work , but at the same time , had destroyed an old part of himself , a part that he wasn ’ t necessarily proud of anymore . He felt rejuvenated , revitalized , like a phoenix who had just been born again from ash . A fitting metaphor , he thought with a smile , as he walked back inside his house . He shut the door , and turned out the patio lights . The pile of ash sat there , until the wind began to pick up . Slowly , the pile began to get smaller , as the ash was carried away into the air . Eventually , as the writer lay asleep in his bed , the last of the ashes disappeared , blown off in the breeze . And in that moment , the writer and Daniel , his creation , both knew peace .\": '5 5 5 5 4', \"Mozzie let himself be shoved into the wall . Let ? He smirked . By let , is is of course meant that Mozzie did n't resist being shoved into the wall . With his hands bound before him and his body bruised and burnt from the torture , let was a very subjective word . So , Mozzie let himself be shoved into the wall . Mozzie let Haddock shove him toward the hole he 'd blown in the back of the citadel . Mozzie even let him slam the butt of his rifle into his kidney when Mozzie did n't move fast enough . Grave robbing was n't really Mozzie 's thing . He liked mysteries and liked being the one to solve them . When Haddock first came to him with the spear haft , the engravings upon it had n't meant much , but when Haddock inferred that that the engravings were part of a map a conquistador had made after leaving El Dorado , Mozzie could n't resist . He 'd scanned it , projected it , stretched it out into two dimensional print outs , tested the metal of the spear head , identified the wood in the haft , compared the inscriptions , and hit up Spain for the opportunity to search for the spear section in their historical records . After all that , his break came from a Redditor who 's father had once worked security for a museum in Chicago . And thanks to that tip , Mozzie was able to locate the rest of the spear and even the helm that completed the map and provided the key . `` Move . '' Haddock snapped , jabbing the barrel of his rifle into the fatty part of Mozzie 's thigh . `` I-I am . '' Mozzie called back . The place is full of spider webs and the damn floor is uneven . `` I . . . said move . '' Haddock growled , jabbing him again . `` Dammit , if I twist my ankle or break my fucking leg , then you 're going to have to carry me through this shitty place to unlock the door . So , let me pick my way on my own and just follow me . I 'm bound and bruised and beaten . What the fuck . Just stop jabbing me . '' Mozzie could n't really see Haddock 's face , but the glass eye in his right socket twinkled with unholy light . Haddock wiped his brow with a handkerchief , grunted , then responded to Mozzie 's reasonable sounding rant by firing a shot into the tunnel floor right between Mozzie 's feet . Mozzie swore and went back to trail blazing the spider infested tunnel . He stopped when the floor of the tunnel spread out and the ceiling raised and the corridor went from a barrel vaulted construct to tall rectangular chamber . Mozzie stopped and shined his light upon the floor . They had glyphs etched into them . `` Move ! '' Haddock called . `` Stop . I think the floor 's booby trapped . '' Mozzie reasoned . Haddock squeezed up beside Mozzie and looked at the floor . `` How ? '' Haddock did n't talk much , but when he did , brevity was solemnly embraced . `` Not sure . I 've researched these types of traps before . Some of the panels are , some of them are thin clay plates . Step on the wrong one , and your foot plunges through and trips what ever trigger lies below it . Haddock glared at him . `` Sorry . I do n't know what traps the triggers will set off . There 's no way of knowing . '' Haddock grunted and slid back into the tunnel . A moment later one of the local thugs he 'd brought was pressed in to the mouth of the tunnel beside me . `` What want , boss ? '' The thug asked . `` Kill snakes . '' Haddock ordered , catching Mozzie 's eye . The thug frowned , but pulled out his machete . He gave the prisoner a quick glance and marched out into the chamber ahead of them . His third step punched through a tile . There was the echoing hiss in the walls , and from above a tiny pebble fell on the henchmen 's head and bounced off . He looked up just in time to catch the three inch spear in the small of his throat . It slammed to a stop about a foot from the floor , impaling the man who hung suspended on the spike . `` Go . '' Haddock ordered . As they moved forward , Haddock would probe the tiles with the end of his rifle . Sometimes the tiles would break away and nothing happened , and sometimes they 'd break away and trip the trigger and let another pole slam down before them . By the time they reached the far side of the corridor , a safe path had been found and marked for their return . Mozzie was made to wait while the rest of the henchmen made their way across . Mozzie filled that time by studying the next corridor . It was taller and narrower , but just as dark and there were glyphs on the walls like those on the floor . The floor in the corridor was tiled much like the chamber had been . The only difference he saw was the glyphs engraved on these floor tiles were all the same and , he recognized them . `` What of these ? '' Haddock asked . `` They warn the proud man to be humble . '' Mozzie replied . `` A psalm perhaps . '' Mozzie noticed the holes near the tiles in the wall and noticed their height from the ground . `` Trap ? '' Haddock probed at one of the tiles , it did nothing . `` Maybe . Perhaps they seek to make us comfortable with the uniform warning on all the tiles . I 'll keep watch on the floor to see if any of them change . You do the same with the tiles on the wall . If you see a change in any of the glyphs let me know . Haddock 's reply was another grunt and a prod from the rifle barrel . Mozzie moved forward , cringing in fear that his play would be discovered , but Haddock came in proud like his henchmen and kept his one good eye on the tiles on the wall . Half way down the corridor , a tile tilts under Mozzie 's foot and the sound of a click was the only warning before the spikes slammed out from the sides of the tunnel all at heart and head 's height . Haddock weakly struggled as he was pierced from both sides . The many of the henchmen cried out , but some did n't . One of them in the back had stooped down just a moment before the blades slid out and in his panic to escape the trap , he stumbled back into the chamber and promptly stepped through a clay tile and was impaled as the first henchman had been . Mozzie leaned against the tunnel wall and wept for what he 'd done . He suspected what the nature of the trap would be . All he had to say was for them to keep low and they would all make it through safely . He 'd seen Haddock kill men before , and despite his callous disregard for life , he 'd always made it quick and painless . Mozzie was a scholar . He was the adventuring kind . He was n't fighter . He was n't a soldier . He 'd never killed before , and if he had , he would have chosen to make it quick and painless . The men were still struggling on the ends of the barbs and Haddock 's one good eyes slowly swiveled down like a damning accusation and came to rest on him . `` You killed Maria . '' Mozzie said by way of explanation . The light in Haddock 's eyes seemed to fade and Mozzie knew he had finally succumb . He looked back at the chamber with the two impaled henchmen and the way out and into the dark ahead . He rose and began stripping the dead men of their gear . He used a confiscated machete to cut his bonds , then with a deep breath and an explosive sigh of surrender , Mozzie moved forward into the dark . Hacking at spider webs with the machete , and clutching a stolen Luger in his other hand to shoot snakes and other animals with . He never wanted to be a tomb raider , but now that he found himself at the precipice of becoming one , he could n't find the moral strength to leave . He wiped at his brow with the back of his hand and smiled and that was how Mozzie entered the business . He pushed forward wondering if Mozzie Merchant would make a good tomb raiding moniker . He hoped so because that was his name and he had no plans to change it . `` I should buy a hat . '' He mumbled as the darkness swallowed him up .\": '5 4 4 5 4', \"`` I 've been trying to make this a thing for a while now . I 'm not sure why . '' I said to the boy , his face pale .

'' `` I do n't want to go , '' I replied . `` But I 's not sure I want to stay here . '' My voice was quiet , and he was quiet . I could hear the fear in his voice , but I could n't tell if it was from fear or from fear of me . I was n't sure . `` What if I do ? '' I asked , but he did n't answer . `` You 're going to get hurt . '' he said , his voice becoming more and more desperate . `` Yeah , I know . '' The boy said , tears in his eyes . `` That 's the worst part . '' And he fell to the ground . `` It 's all over . '' His eyes were wet . `` The thing is , I do not want to be here . I want you to be safe . '' But he did not respond . I did n textbooks , I did not want him to be worried about me . `` Do n't worry , '' he told me , and then he turned to the sky . `` We 're not going to die .

I felt the wind on my face . * `` Do you have any idea what happened ? '' He asked , his hand on my shoulder . `` See , '' My arms were cold .

I looked down , and saw the forest . I stood there , and waited . The world faded away , and for a moment , I was alone . Then , I heard the sound of my heart beating again . `` Hey , '' it said .

Of course no one would ever know he was quoting me . He did n't . That is both my curse and my cause , and now it is your turn to share this burden for a moment , until you are mercifully allowed to forget me , too . I have no idea whether you , *dear reader , * are one person , a thousand , tens of thousands . I have no idea whether you are reading my words directly , or if you are reading the words of one of my previous readers , a temporally branching tree of individuals who have adapted my words into their own . I actually have no way of knowing whether *I* am writing my own words , as a singular entity who remembers every interaction he remembers whenever he remembers them , leading back to the first foggy recollections of his storied past . As far as I know , I have always been me , all of my ideas and memories are original as I think , remember , synthesize and share them . *Whatever the truth may be* , whatever that is anymore , here I am , right now , alone with only my thoughts and you . If I am immortal -- and I have a feeling I Am immortal -- though one can never truly Know they 're immortal -- then what else is there to do but try to share what I have learned so that you might learn from my mistakes and experiences so as to make your journey easier , your burden lighter , your suffering lessened , your potential greater . Unless , of course , I am so ambivalent , so resentful , so ashamed , so exhausted that I 'm simply trying to end all this madness and find peace at the price of non-existence for all . I would offer you the choice as whether to open This Pandora 's Box , or to stay in The Garden , but it 's too late , we 've already crossed that threshold . The decision was made by both of us , and by neither . At the end of this sentence , here we are -- even if you turn back now , the seal has been broken ; history has already been changed . You have read this far through the threshold , there 's no point in turning back , is there ? How do you intentionally forget something ? That happens outside of your control , and mine . Now that we 've crossed this threshold , with neither of us truly knowing the separation between our minds in space or time , I will tell you a short story -- well , short to me , anyway ; I 'm still trying to figure out the game of influencing the influential in one hundred forty characters or fewer . ( Please excuse the aggressive use of semi-colons , I 've decided to start throwing them around indiscriminately , as they are going out of fashion . ) There was a time when I was a traveler on a road -- a real body on a real road , not words spoken aloud , stories on a page or transmitted via radio waves , not digitized with ones and zeros then reconstituted with 3D graphics in virtual reality , -- I was a man in the flesh , on a road . I understand this is a paradox itself , of course , as the only way to relate this story is to *use* one of those means of communication , but to understand this story , you must understand the distinction . You can choose to believe me or not , you can try to reassemble these words that I say into a picture of the assertion of my remembered reality , but you are over there reading this and I am over here writing it , and I was over then traveling on a road from somewhen to somewhere , neither of those details relevant to this story , other than to imply the motion of travel and the existence of *I* , who for the sake of this story we shall call *the Historian , * though we can probably agree is an impractical name in the reality you and I presently share . I 'm *Batman* not *the Batman . * This was the time before meta . On this road -- and by this I mean a metaphorical line which is a vector along which I held a position -- on this road , I saw at some distance a crossroads and what would turn out to be a girl standing at it . For the sake of the simplicity of this story , assume I am a boy , and we were both heterosexual and each knew of no other way to be , so we could not judge anything other than that she was girl and I was boy . We only knew what we had brought with us on this road , which was very little , back then . Please do not judge us for our simple ignorance , back where . As I approached , I could see the moment she realized I was coming -- I kicked a rock under my worn sandal , pushing a scraping sound forward to her ears , which caused a tensing of her body . Yet she did not turn to see me . She continued to stand at the crossroads and consider her options . I could only assume she had traveled from the same direction as I and had no reason to consider returning , as she never once turned back and looked the direction I had traveled . Only later did I consider whether she *could* see the road upon which I had traveled , a road which was ending as I approached her . Only later did I consider whether I could have turned around and gone back the way I 'd come , as I never did . Only later did I consider the possibility that she had stopped along her path , deciding whether to continue or to turn back , as she and I would never speak about this moment of decision ever again . I arrived at the crossroads and walked astride her , coming to rest in each other 's peripheral vision , neither of us turning to look at the other . The fork in the road was pronounced ; the view of each offered differing promises and cautions . Curving to the left , the path descended into a darkening forest that might give way to jungle as the elevation declined -- the trees thickened to sheets of green giving way to mists of fog below . The way would be dark but would likely afford water , food and shelter , at the cost of visibility . Curving to the right the path climbed alongside a mountain -- not too steep as to make climbing a challenge , yet one easily see how the temperature would drop and the terrain would become more difficult as the elevation increased . Reaching the summit of this path would afford a greater view of the area , and there would likely be water and fish . The increased visibility would provide a greater insights to predator and prey alike . One could neither see through the trees nor over the mountain . Either could lead to our destruction , or either could lead us to the land beside the sea -- a place we both somehow knew would offer the best chance for survival . She spoke first , in a language that was close enough to those I knew to be understood , but unlike anything I 'd ever heard . `` Now the choice is more difficult . '' Wait a moment , reader , let me try to approximate the difference -- You and I speak a language far closer to each other than either of us do compared to her language then . `` Noo , mer path twix twyne . '' [ King James Version , Gaelic Edition ] At the time , I kin it . Her decisions had doubled . Left or Right , Together or Apart . Instead of one person deciding between two roads , we were now a group of two , deciding between two roads , and also whether to continue together or apart . A simplistic view would be that we were each two separate entities , each capable of making our own choices , and we would do so , and the results would be the happenstance of our individual decisions . If we both decided to go left , it would have been LL and we would have traveled together . If we both decided to go right , it would have ben RR and we would have traveled together . If we decided in opposition , it would have been LR or RL , and we would have traveled apart . But we stood at the crossroads together , understanding that we could not know for certain whether we 'd ultimately be allies or competitors , lovers or enemies , each other 's saviors or destruction , or simply lines that moved in their own directions , bounced along our individual trajectories by this one moment . If I was trying to be too clever by half , I 'd leave the story here , *dear reader* , and allow you to ponder the depth of this decision , and perhaps this is the moment we part ways . You may decide to do exactly that , or you may read the comment that follows . What follows is the coda to the oldest story every told , and will be condemned to repeat it if we can not learn .\": '5 5 5 4 2', \"I 've never been much of a Christmas fan .

'' He extended a wrist so that Dave could see the garish scar tracing across his lower arm . `` Put all that old shit behind you , man . '' Dave shot back . `` So you were abused , so you were poor , so you were alone . So fucking what ? That life was 100 years ago . Everyone here is looking for the same thing : a chance at a *new* one . '' His hands gestured sweepingly at the room around them and the rows upon rows of similarly lost souls waiting in line to get another bite at the apple . `` Plus , believe me when I say that the ladies down there are getting hotter and easier with each passing century . '' Sam smiled . His friend was amazingly animated for a dead guy , with a thick hearty laugh and an unrivaled passion for getting laid . Although Dave was just shy of 3000 years old , he could still pick up a girl less than a hundredth of his age with just a devilish wink and a lewd joke . `` Thanks , Dave . I just hope I have better luck this time . '' Dave 's brow furrowed . Sam could see gears churning deep inside his head . `` Come with me , Sam . '' Dave 's big mitts throttled Sam 's arm as he dragged his friend out of line . `` Hey , man ! I 've been waiting all morning ! '' Sam protested , but Dave ignored this and kept pulling him up toward the front of the line . His eyes scanned the ticket windows before finally locking onto his target . `` Hey there , gorgeous , '' Dave purred at the heavy-set blonde plopped behind a thick layer of plexi and an even thicker layer of makeup . `` Dave ! '' Her chubby face blushed crimson with a chubby smile . `` Who 's your cute friend ? '' `` Annie , meet Sam . Sam , this is Annie . '' Dave pushed his friend up to the counter . `` We 're in need of some *luck* , '' he whispered , stressing the last word . Annie let out a small laugh . `` Well , let me see what I can find for you . '' Her plump fingers banged away at a computer terminal as her eyes scanned down through the results . `` You might be in luck , Dave . I do have a handful of expecting mothers . All chest-sized double-D . Perfect for a baby of your ... *reputation* . '' Sam stared in shock at Dave . `` Double-Ds ? '' `` What ? You might as well have something fun to play with during those early years ! '' Dave retorted with a laugh of his own . Sam shuddered in disgust as he turned back toward Annie . `` I was hoping for maybe a nice , normal family . Decent income and a safe neighborhood . Anything like that ? '' Annie 's eyes continued to scan before finally settling on one entry in particular . `` This one here sounds perfect ! Her bio says that she 's an heiress of a major hotel chain and was the star of a major movie that was seen by millions of people worldwide . I think she would make an ideal mother ! '' `` She might be a little too perfect . '' Sam 's smile faded . `` It sounds like she would be in very high demand . Do you really think you can slot me in ? '' Annie stifled a giggle as she looked up at Dave and Sam . `` Trust me , I think her slot would have no trouble fitting *both* of you . ''\": '5 4 4 5 5', \"`` This is the day . '' The commander of the fleet of space ships had been preparing for this moment for a long time . They had been waiting for this day for a very long time , for a time . He had been a leader in the galactic war for many years , and he had been the first to realize that the only way to stop the war was to use the technology that they had been given . The world had been spinning in circles for a while . The human race had been on the brink of extinction for so long , and they had no idea what to do . They understood that they could not fight alone . They were too weak , too weak to fight the aliens . They needed to be joined by others , and the most useful people to fight against the aliens were the ones who could be trained . It was not easy . They could not be trained to fight alone , and those who could not were forced to fight together . The soldiers had to be trained and trained together . They went into the stars and fought , and then they were trained again . They would fight , and fight , until they were no longer needed . They became the best fighters , and fought the aliens , and won . It had been an honor , and it had been fun . They lost their first battles , but they had won the war , and now they were ready to fight again . It would be another day . It has been a long and difficult day . The mission had been so hard , and so long ago . The ship was n't built to last . The crew of the ship had been told that they would never see their home planet again . The ships had never been built to withstand the heat of the sun , and had been built for a purpose , and there was no way to fight in the sun . The hull had been stripped away from the ship , and all that was left was the inside . The captain had been sent to the ship to repair the ship . The command had been left behind , and was not to be used again . He was to be sent to a new planet , but he was not told to go there . He would be sent back to his ship , but there was a new mission . It took him a while to figure out how to get there . It seemed like an impossible mission , but it had to happen . He knew that the mission was to destroy the aliens and destroy the ships . He did n't know how , but the ship was built to do it . He could not stop it . The men and women who had been selected for the mission were sent to another planet . He went to the planet , and began to search for the ship that was supposed to be the last . He found it . It looked like a ship , with a few things , but nothing special . He turned around to look for the captain , and found him . He pulled out a small box , and opened it . Inside was a small , rectangular box , with the word `` ON '' written on it . `` This is it , '' he said . `` I need to know why this is happening . '' He opened the box , but could n't read the words . He looked inside , and saw a small portion of the box . `` There is something in this box that is not human , '' the box said . He picked up the box and read it . There was a line , and a small button . `` It says : '' It read `` ON , '' and it was a long , long line . The line read `` On '' , and when it was finished , it read `` OFF , '' again , and again , it said `` ON .

It read 8:50 . I walked down the hallway and turned on the light . I had to get to the living room . I saw my wife , my son , my daughter , and my brother . I ran into the livingroom and ran to my room . As I walked in , I saw the lights on my bed . I turned on my phone and saw the message . I opened it and read the message : `` I have a match with the Galactic Deathball , and we 're winning . Assemble your team of 20 humans . If you lose , the planet will be destroyed . If we win , we 'll destroy you . If not , we will be damn . '' I opened the message and read it again . It had the same message : '' I am the Galactic deathball , you have a team of twenty humans .

I have to deal , almost exclusively , with these wackjobs . “ Okay , What the everloving shit is it this time ? ” I asked , as the little mazda ’ s four cylinders strained to keep me above 80 ( in a 40 mph zone , mind you ) which was , impossibly , mostly free of traffic . Why can ’ t the streets ever be this clear in this city when I ’ m NOT dealing with some wacko trying to save the free world or catch his wife or whatever ? “ Russian nukes again ? That was fun . Someone shot out my windshield on that one. ” I grit my teeth , as I pull into a handbrake turn “ Somebody kidnap your kid ? ” The man in the back ’ s face was a mask of determination , eyes locked on the car in front of us . “ Concentrate on driving .

You can ’ t stop ! If he gets away again , there ’ s no telling how may people might die ! ” For anybody else , that ’ d be a worthy argument . However , I lived through the aforementioned Russian nuke fiasco mentioned above .

She was volunteering at a school today to give a speak and ... '' The voice was muffled it sounded like the voice was trying to hold back a cry .

''\": '5 4 5 5 5', \"I found this very interesting as I had a very strange encounter with the lottery . @ Thenre , I am assuming you are talking about powerball ? When you posted those numbers , you never had a powerball number . So I checked the powerball history combining those 6 numbers the 4 different ways , and they never did all come up . However , using 5 as the powerball 4 numbers did come up about a month ago . Also , interestingly , at least 3 of these numbers come up with some frequency . About 9 years ago I was onto the lottery numbers , but I did not have them quite right . Then about a month later all the lottery numbers that had hit on May 26 , 2005 came up on the back of my ticket numbers . None of the tickets were worth anything , and sadly one of them with the winning 33 at the end of the ticket number , which had been the winning number on May 26 , 2005 was kept by the retailer . Then the lottery machine reset the ticket numbers and by coincidence I ended up with another lottery ticket with the same exact ticket number with the 33 at the end that I had lost ! I have a photo copy of this . After that , things got strange with the lottery . Numbers were posted at the store for the next week , yet they had not been drawn yet . I asked about this , but the lady working at the store said it must be some kind of mistake . So I got the bright idea to play these numbers , but it was a bad idea . I filled out the ticket , and on the way to the store a truck exactly like mine swerved into my lane and almost hit me head on . I almost turned around , but I thought they are only numbers . When I submitted my card , the lady at the store asked me if I was sure I wanted to play those numbers . Strange , that had never been asked before . The machine took a real long time to print out the numbers . As I was handed the ticket I looked behind me . The girl behind me was wearing a shirt with a broken heart on it . It said `` you broke it , now you have to fix it '' . I thought it must be some weird coincidence . Btw , those numbers did not come up . That night I watched Constantine at my ex wifes house , they just happened to be watching it . It was like Hell was coming out of the TV . I am normally a normal guy , but my ex and her friends could tell I was losing it . I went home , and noticed the state flag at the firehouse was inverted . Instead of a blue background and yellow seal , it had a yellow background , and blue seal . It was like I was in an alternate universe . As it got light I took my truck and went into the mountains to get away from it all . I walked up an old logging road . There were flowers that were beautiful when I walked by , but when I would turn around there would be silk worms all over them , Weird , they were not there when I walked by . It was August , and very hot . I met a couple walking down the road . Strange , no one usually hiked this road . Strangely , when they talked to me they seemed confused , and did not know what day it was . I could not find the trail to the creek , so I finally got so thirsty , and was not thinking right . I left my pants and coat at a specific forest service marking because I was so hot , walked down to the creek down a very steep bank in my shorts and t shirt , drank a bunch of water , and hiked down a very treacherous creek . I finally found the trail and hiked out to my truck and drove home . I had my wallet in my pants . Things were still askew in my mind when I hiked back up to get my pants and wallet two days later . Very strangely , my pants were not at the forest sevice marked coordinate where I put them , but on the next coordinate up ! It was like reality had changed slightly from the way it had been . Not only that , they were tearing that road up for no apparent reason . I had to go around a guy on the ungated road digging part of the road out with a backhoe . I had never seen him before , even though this was a very small town . He had his shirt off and had strange tattoos running down his back . He also had very odd pale blue eyes that were very blue . I could n't help but ask , and he said they were contacts he wore for the chicks . It was sunny out , and I never saw contacts . This was not the type of guy that looked like he would be operating a backhoe for the Forest Service . They tore the whole gated logging road and the road I drove up over the next few days , and replaced all culverts , even though it did not need to be done , almost like they were fixing whatever glitch I had caused . I told some friends what had happened and drove them up that road . They did not know what to think , but did not discount m story . I was well liked and respected around there . There were some other things that happened , but I will not get into it all . Like right when this was happening I tried to call my Mother , but there were no outgoing calls from my town long distance . Eventually , every thing returned to normal . I am not giving out my real name or where this took place . What do you all think ?\": '2 5 4 1 5', \"We had been sent on a divine mission .

The panting knight 's vision remained fixated ahead , inferring the growing danger from their footsteps , twigs snapping underfoot , and the guttural grunts and roars which seemed to almost wet his neck with their slobbering howls . The princess in his arms squealed with terror as one hurled a hand axe which the shinning man ducked under at the last second . `` Enough is enough '' he thought , as they entered a sun-bathed clearing , in a moment he placed the maiden at the foot of a royal oak and spun around to face the beasts . He counted five Orcs and chuckled briefly at the one who he now saw had an arrow comically sticking out of an eye socket . The battle lasted seconds , with a glint of light the knight drew his silver sword and sliced three of the orcs with a seemingly single blow that left their bodies to freeze upright then slide in half lazily revealing the perfect cut made through their waists . `` God I love that . '' He muttered . Then in a second streak , he swung the sword in a twisting arc which took the sword and attached arm of an advancing Orc , finally throwing the blade like a javelin straight through the last green face 's open maw . After retrieving the blade he walked back to the tree where the beautiful woman in silk leapt to her feet . `` My Hero ! You have saved me from the horde , now come !

Eventually being forced by the game to kill the mad King . He grabbed a ceramic bowl from the top shelf and a box of 'Krispy Krunch ' from the lowest . It was not despite this plot knowledge that he had kissed the princess but because of it ; for if he had confronted her with his knowledge of the murderous dictatorship he would then have to fight a quicktime-induced battle with her to avoid being stabbed , a fight which could only end in her death and his attacking the castle not from within the royal family but from outside the gates and through the creation of a people 's rebellion .

Even unplugged speakers issued the proclamation , somehow being audible despite the lack of power . The first question on everyone 's minds was `` Who could have sent the message ? '' The second was `` What 's Galactic Deathball ? '' Slowly , over the next few months , wars between nations ground to a halt , generations-longs conflicts were quietly resolved , and even the most isolationist governments attended meetings with other world leaders . The question on everyone 's minds : How do we prepare for something when we have no idea when it will come or what it is . The long-term changes were n't immediately apparent to the common man not privy to the secret backroom discussions , though everyone knew something was going on when the Olympics was abruptly altered , it 's events taking on a more ... martial bent . Governments started sponsoring training facilities , focusing on multi-discipline events , such as triathlons , and ski-and-shoot , and even new combination sports such as the MMArathon . It became obvious to anyone paying attention that the world was training `` peak human '' superheros to compete in the Galactic Deathball , and the contenders were rewarded handsomely . Years passed without incidence , and slowly the unity caused by the message was ground away by the remorseless passage of time . The new sports lost their initial vigor , and in many countries , their sponsorship . But they were popular enough in their own niche that there was still a significant community of practitioners . And the the second message , as it was called , occurred . A copy of The Rulebook appeared next to every person on the planet , though this time staggered to appear as they slept . The book was written in two languages , one unknown and eye-searingly alien , the other in the mother tongue of the recipient . One upside was that we were handed the greatest rosetta stone ever made , and the alien language was deciphered almost as fast as it took to upload the scans to the internet . The Rulebook is actually somewhat of a misnomer , most of the text was the history of the games , descriptions of previous events , and the sort of background information you would expect from a scholarly work rather than a purely technical document explaining the game . But that might have been because the game was absurdly simple . First , the field : An equilateral multi-sided polygon with a minimum of 4 sides a minimum of roughly 1/4 mile across and a maximum of a little under 1/2 mile across . The number of sides is twice the number of teams participating . Each team starts at a face of the polygon arrayed as they choose , and teams draw lots to determine the order that they chose which face where they start . The titular Deathball , a 1/4 kilo lump of iron with handholds designed to be easily grasped by all participating species , starts in the exact center of the field . At the signal , everyone has 5 seconds to get onto the field . If you leave the field without carrying the deathball , you die . If you leave the field carrying the deathball , you choose who dies and the field reset . The game ends when all but one team is eliminated . The only restrictions on players is they must not be artificially modified members of their species , and the only equipment allowed must be worn and extend no more than roughly 4mm from the surface of the skin in one pose . Immediately it became obvious that it was a game of strength , speed and , most of all , endurance . MMArathon immediately shot up in popularity . Two more years passed before The Ship arrived to claim the contenders . We were prepared , our strategies finalized , and the team had practiced . A non-lethal form of Deathball was now a planetary sport with 8 world championships already claimed , despite the short period of time we 'd had the rules . The team , the Heroes of Earth , boarded the ship to the thunderous roar of cheering crowds . The team was comprised of some of the finest examples of physical excellence from across the planet . A few long distance sprinters built for speed , not power . Some of the most brutal martial artists to ever grace the ring . All of them with the endurance to run 30 miles and fight a dozen back to back matches at the end . When the match was about to being , every monitor , screen , and projector on the planet turned on of it 's own accord and we watched . And waited . And worried . It turns out we did n't need to worry . The aliens seemed to have the same idea that we had , send a few fast runners to get the ball and return it to pick off as many of the opposing team as possible before everyone was too worn out and the brawling began . The four minute mile was first achieved in 1954 . The Adrian could make it in three and a half minutes -- and he was on the team . The aliens had barely made it halfway to the ball by the time Adrian made it out of bounds , taking less than two minutes to cross the entire arena , barely even slowing to grab the ball . He had eliminated 7 of the opposing team before he was too tired to continue . His second , who could make a mile in three minutes and 45 seconds , eliminated 4 more . The aliens realizing they could never make it to the ball on time , tried to start next to us whenever possible and force our team members out of the arena . They lost 5 more before they gave that up as a bad job . It turns out we were significantly better grapplers than they were . Sure , they were 8 feet tall and covered in muscles in sinew , but apparently they were n't terribly dense , weighing a bit under 300 pounds , and leverage was working against them . One was literally carried overhead and tossed over the line . By the time they were down to 3 people , we still had our full 20-man team . They went into a sort of berserk rage and charged with the intent of hurting , maybe even killing one of our team outright . It ... did n't work well . Torrez played bullfighter and let one of them charge right out of the arena . Jenkins counter-charged one , headbutted it right in the gut , and somehow knocked it out with the one hit . It was ... kinda pathetic , actually . Humanity as a whole went from desperate and afraid to feeling really bad for the other team . They were outmatched from the start and never had a chance . But in deathball , there 's no sportsmanship . It 's win or die , and if we had to choose , we 'd choose win . Every time .\": '5 5 5 5 5', \"`` You are a very talented team Rocket .

Even with amazing technology : flying cars , time machines , hover boards and more ; things were n't getting any better . So , Secret Government Intelligences from different countries had the bright idea that in order to change the future , you 'd have to alter the past . It was decided that they would try music to promote a better world and future . MISSION WATERLOO . This would be Sweden 's mission . To send back four individuals in the 1970 's to form a Disco group to change the world . There they stood in all their glory , beautiful space children of the future . They called themselves ABBA . They would be acclaimed as a great band with powerful messages that promote positivity in their songs . Dancing Queen would be one of the most successful `` weapons '' to change the world . Who could forget the Swedish royalty sitting as an audience to a then young ABBA performing their hearts away . It would move World Leaders worldwide to be more laid back . Money , Money , Money would raise awareness about Capitalism and would borrow time before it really took over until the mid 90 's when Big Business Corporations would finally unfortunately take over . Gim me ! Gim me ! Gim me ! would be one of the starts to push women into independence and move towards actual people that can play as hard as any man . As one of the best future musical Secret Agents I definitely want to say Thank You for the Music , ABBA , and promoting a better wonderful world . All missions from each country turned out to be successful up until the 2000 's . Remember Ziggy Stardust ? He turned out to be an alien and managed to promote a postitive influence on UK and American culture to be more open-minded and a little bit different . Nena from Germany ( I never would have guessed she was from the future ! ) would have a powerful anthem with 99 Luft Balloons to think twice about war and it 's negative effects . And this list continues ... In the 2000 's alien terrorists would get their hands on time travel as well and send back agents of their own . For example , Miley Cyrus would be sent to alter the world in being more revolting , promiscuous , and ridiculous as easy prey to the aliens that would come in 2019 . Her very mission was to try to promote twerking , a weird act that was to catch on so that aliens could easily anally probe their victims . Fortunately , it only caught on as a trend and never became successful . Yet , still we will keep fighting . The U.S. currently has Agent Katy Perry on the job trying to promote a better world . I feared for a second that she would give herself away with such obvious imagery , ie . E.T. , but luckily no one bought it and she continues to be successful with her mission with such anthems as Roar and Firework to keep on fighting the good fight . Musical Secret Agents will continue to battle on through songs and there 's no telling who the winner will be at this point . Oh and watch out for Meghan Trainor . She is currently one of the most dangerous Musical Terrorists to date .\": '5 5 5 5 4', \"Who remembers their blood type anyway ? This question was plastered on the back of Jane 's mind as she arrived at her first college class that day , like the street tag on the local Applebees that refused to fade . What did *bubblesnot* mean anyway ? Jane was n't particularly excited for her English 101 class that day anyway , and this disinterest just allowed her creeping thoughts more room to establish a semi-permanent residence in her psyche . She never had especially high aspirations for her post-high school career , but he parents were willing to front the bill , so what the hell ? Jane 's mind seemed to be occupied with blood type a lot these days , ever since she met that boy on check-in day , you know *that boy* . Ever since she was a little girl , Jane had been raised a good Christian . She knew the rules . Rule one : no sex before marriage . Rule two : only marry a man with the same blood type . These rules seemed simple enough growing up , but now she did n't know what to think . When she saw him sitting in his Toyota Tacoma outside her dorm , with his head swaying to the beat of *Killing in the Name* by Rage Against the MAchine that bumped inside the cab , Jane knew the world as she knew it had ended . She gathered hereself as best she could and made her way to her first class . Jane endured her English 101 class without incident . She did not pay much attention , but something her teacher said about Oedipus really spoke to her . On the way out the door , she ran into *him* again . `` Hey . '' He said , letting his gaze fall over her for a brief moment . To Jane it seemed like an eternity . `` Oh , hi . '' Jane managed to muster , but he was already gone . It did n't matter . The connection must have been obvious to anyone around . Jane continued home with an extra spring in her step . She even allowed herself a moment to stop and admire the *bubblesnot* tag on the way home . She came to the conclusion that none of it mattered , not the blood type , not her idiot parent 's forcefed ideologies . She had figured it out . *He* was the one . When she ran the picture that she had taken on her phone when he was in his truck through the universal database , she found out that he was O+ , and she did n't even care . He was worth it . Jane kept her eyes peeled all of the next day for the boy of her dreams . In addtition to his blood type , she had learned that his name was James . It seemed fitting . Finally , she saw him leaving the Sciences building . He did n't notice her sitting in the panel van she had rented after class the day before , but he would . She followed him as he turned onto Main Street , and then again as he turned into a neighborhood right past the Walmart . When he finally turned into a driveway at the end of the street , she pulled the van to a halt across the street .

'' Then she turned and walked away from me . I looked at my hands . I felt the tears . I tried to stop them , but I could n't . I could tell that they were n't tears of happiness , but they were tears of sadness . I was a coward . I had done something wrong . The Lone Woundederer looked at his hands . He was crying .

Although I know the consequences , I 'm never able to keep myself from coming here . This is the darkest place I know , the most quiet , the most still . It is the one place that has n't changed much . Hours literally escape me as I stare out the smudged , fogged glass panes . All I can do is reminisce , how clean and absolutely gleaming these windows once were . The entire city lives , breathes and moves on , while I sit here imagining what it would be like if I did none of those things . Everything has changed since childhood . Not just in the typical sense where a person grows and matures , learning the world is truly cruel . The world around me has literally changed form . The air feels a bit more like needles within your lungs every time you inhale . The sunlight hits you in such a way ... it feels like slowly your skin has started to boil . The nights sky has grown so dark and velvety that the streets and horizon blend into one , making stars indistinguishable from street lights . It seems each year the moon grows increasingly larger within the sky . I remember being a child and hearing news stories about elderly people reaching their 100th birthday . If I 'm incredibly lucky , I might make it to see my 50th birthday . I 'm not very lucky , though . So I break the rules . My entire family has been killed , so what do I have to continue going for ? I come back here , even though it is outside of the Modified Living Zone . I ca n't help myself . When I come back here and sit for hours I can forget all the terrible years . The war , the famine , the uninhabitable lands that are all now abandoned ... None of them exist when I sit here and let time slip by . This home is the last connection in existence to my old life . No one else ever seems to come back meaning minimal risk in getting caught , although the concern is always present in my mind . I do n't think anyone comes back because they are all dead . At 33 , I 'm one of the oldest living citizens in our MLZ .

The crackle of the fire , the sound of the wind outside , a soft chime of the bells , all seem to dance at her tune . God I love her . Words lodge in my throat and my sweat glands seem to have a life of my own every time I look at her . She sashays around the kitchen dancing on the tune she created . She looks as if she has been photoshopped in real life . Perfect hair , body face , lips , smile . Hell , her body is so impeccable that it must be chiseled by the Michelangelo himself ? I do n't know . I do n't know much about art . She does though . Oh yes , she could talk for hours about art and classical music and opera and all that . Me ? I can talk about football ... and beer . If beer is a good topic for conversation . You see , I am a regular Joe . Probably competing for the most boring person title . I wake up , work , come back , watch television , drool over for my wife , sleep , rinse and repeat . Nothing spectacular . Except the gem of a wife god knows how I managed to score . The train of my thought must have reached a destination beyond this dimension because it took my wife some shaking me to crash me down to this world . 'Down to earth bozo ! What are you thinking ? ! '' * '' What can I possibly think about ? Come here ! `` * I grabbed her waist and brought her down to my lap . Her lips turned to express mortification but her eyes gave her away . `` What are doing ? Stop being a caveman bozo ! '' She could n't complete the rest because I proceeded to kiss her . Fuck . The warmth of her skin melted into my soul and threatened to burn me . This is it . End me now as a happy man . Perfect . Did I say that ? My wife has a habit of sleeping early . And I know it 's going to sound weird but we sleep in different rooms as well . Maybe a lot of couples do this but once I made a mistake of sharing this with a friend and boy did I never heard the end of it . `` She 's using you . `` , `` She must be cheating with someone , '' `` She 's weird . Break up with her ' . No thanks . Initially even I thought it was weird but our sex life is hot and she is 11 on a scale of 10 , so who am I to complain ? So here I am dozing off on the sofa trying to watch some shit show on the TV . I am almost asleep but the dull thud of the clock as the time turns 10 breaks through the fabric of my dreams .

Standing in front of me is a woman who makes my heart beat in a rhythm possibly impossible for a human being . And she 's not my wife . In fact she is opposite of my wife . She has unruly hair , a freckled face with signs of past pimple breakouts , and a very ... normal body . Like she has tummy fat and heftier thighs , unshaved legs and her own body smell . Just like magic she comes every night and disappears like magic in the morning . At first I used to get alarmed and thought about calling the police . But maybe it was something in her voice , or the loneliness that lurked in her eyes that stopped me from doing that . * '' Hi'* `` May I join you ? What are you watching ? '' * '' Eh nothing . Just flipping through channels '' * `` Mind if i join you ? '' * '' Yeah no problem'* I scoot over to the furtherest side of the couch , away from her presence . She is clouding my mind already . But no avail . Soon we got to talking . And that talking evolved to laughing , teasing and munching popcorn . She was snuggling up to me , her face towards me beckoning me to kiss her . Her smell was n't helping at all . This is wrong ! My goddess is lying in the next room . Next room ! And here I am sitting with some god-knows-who strangers thinking about all the unspeakable things . I love my wife . So why does this feels so right ? So I plunged my lips and drank her . All of her . Her taste , he scent , everything . I was drowning and she was my raft . We kissed each others marks , freckles . Explored every nook , revised every secret . I reveled in her imperfections and reached heights I did not know existed . All the thought of my mind warped itself in a tight corner of my mind . Until it resurfaced again as the lady laid beside me , her breathing hurried and her eyes shut . The thoughts burst back with full vengeance and started the cogs of self loathing and misery . What kind of a man was I ? Cheating on a person I love so much . I have gone insane ! Making love to a person who might just be a product of my dream . This must be it . But the touch of her skin proved otherwise . She is real alright . And I ca n't help but draw comparisons . She looks a blemish in front of my flawless wife . But the difference is what makes her so endearing . I can talk to this person . I can reach to the depth of my soul and bare it her . Bring out those shades I did n't even know existed . Her body does not repel me , it does the exact opposite . Each freckle makes me want to kiss it . Each mark makes me want to dig out the history it hides . Each pimple or fat makes me realize how human she is . And how human I am . All my shame and conscious about my body leaves me and I feel ... content . I can write poetry about my wife . But this woman turns me into a song . I ... .love her . Is it possible to love two people at the same time ? Does that make me wrong ? I must be slipping into the wonder of my dreams . She mutters something in her sleep which caresses me like a lullaby . `` I love you bozo . '' I have heard it somewhere have n't ? Where ?

King Cornell stood anxiously by the fire of his tall nebulous castle . His room was the definition of regal . It was his father 's . Cornell looked at his posthumous portrait of the leader brought his kingdom peace . He always held his tongue and always made eye contact , even for a fleeting moment . Cyrus was approaching . After the coup attempt Cyrus needed to assert his dominance . Being a former noble himself he sought to take the throne of his generous childhood friend . He thought it was necessary . Cornell now had to ensure that he had the sword of center . The center sword clings loudly against the rocks . The thief sprints across enemy lines and down through the impressive moat between the castle . It was cold . Cyrus was in angst over the loss of the sword , the keepsake of his country . As a child he would watch it gleam in the old kings cabinet . Now he needed it to calm his country . It would show his prominence . Maybe he could claim more . Cornell knew that Cyrus was coming . Someone was closer . Cornell looked at his contracted thief in full knowledge of time of arrival . This was one of the best thieves in the known world . This thief was promised death many times . Cornell was tense . He could be killed instantly by the contracted hooded figure . The sword was placed in his hands under the cover of purple crushed velvet . The seven families names gleamed under the hearth and reflected into his eyes . The dry blood of his father shook him to his core . The thief did not make eye contact . He gave the king a couple minutes to fully acknowledge what he had received . He had to kill Cyrus with the blade . Cornell looked out of the window wistfully . The thief took the initiative to remove all assumption of all hostility by the fire . Darkness yielded for the king , the moonlight cast a spell on the landscape . Cornell did not trust this agent , but he did not believe the crossing of their paths came so casually . The guild sent their best , the only one that knew the king well . The thief undressed by the fire , seeking relief from the long journey and frigidity of the moment . With a face to the fire , a green eye peeled over a shoulder took a look at the sullen desperate king . Legs folded by the fire , upright . The daughter of the fallen noble , she carefully removed her soaked clothes by the fire . Cornell bewildered only saw the damaged skin on her back and one green eye held well in contact with him . Many years have passed since they last met . About a dozen actually . Cornell sat by the flames and shed a tear . Her father made this sword . Cornell felt stabbed with no wounds . She kept rigid , facing the fire looking left at her childhood peer . Christie had to outgrow the shame , and had to work hard . The look on her face was as if it was carved in . Her father was noble , she put up with Cyrus and Cornells games . Even though she was only the daughter of a Duke , she was made to be their playmate and servant . After her father died in a freak accident she was ordered to be executed . Cornell : And destiny has brought you back here . Christie : ... . ( Stares ) . Cornell : I ’ ve cursed you one more time . And forever at that . Christie : It 's one heavy ass sword . Cornell : The sins are etched in every letter . Christie : ….Quite the room you have . Cornell : I like the atrium better . We used to play hide and seek when you did n't have chores . Christie : That atrium ? It was frighteningly enormous . Took an hour to clean . Cornell : And charles would never find me , he always would ask you know who to find me . Christie : He would rub his glasses every once in awhile and just not put them on . Cornell : Ha . He always says that he lost a pair . Christie : I remember when cyrus decided to hide in the potting jar . Or was it a fountain ? Cornell : They ’ re all fountains now . It was a jar because… Christie : I had to clean his stupid ass cause he had dirt all over him . Cornell : Did he ever apologize ? Christie : He said sorry , then invited me to dinner .

I thought I was dead , but when I woke up I was able to get up and walk to the nearest hospital . I woke with a start . My wife was screaming at me , `` You 're not dead !

Captain Andersdottir waved her hand slowly , her eyes fixed on Europa in the distance . `` Navigation , '' she called out calmly , running through the final systems check . `` Navigation is go , we are in a stable Jovian orbit and have a clear view of Europa for the duration , '' Lieutenant Tanaka stated flatly . We 'd been in orbit around Jupiter for ten days now with no problems . `` Sciences ? '' `` Analysis software is good-to-go , '' Dr. Hauptman said quietly , staring blankly at her monitors . `` Communications ? '' Andersdottir asked , turning to Lieutenant Gonzales-Smith . `` We 're five-by-five , channel is clear . '' `` Good , '' Andersdottir said as she turned back to face the icy moon . From here it looked about three-quarters the size of a full moon on Earth . We would n't be able to see the impact itself , but the data would arrive almost immediately . `` Telemetry , '' she continued . `` Telemetry is within 0.05 deviation , '' I said , reading the numbers off the tiny screen at my station . `` *Galileo XXV* payload impact in ... thirty seconds . '' We all turned to observe the moon , holding our collective breath as twenty-four satellites on six orbital paths around Europa stood ready . They 'd been collecting data since we 'd arrived , but their true purpose was about to unfold . `` Count from ten , Singh , '' Andersdottir said quietly , hesitant to break the silence . I watched the countdown clock tick down , then ... . `` Ten ... nine ... eight ... seven ... six ... five -- payload will impact the surface in two ... one ... radar confirms payload has reached the target . '' The idea was pretty simple . *Galileo XXV* was essentially a rocket with a 125-foot tungsten rod at the tip . It orbited Europa for six days , making slight adjustments to put it into an orbit with a high-altitude apogee . Today , about three hours ago , *Galileo XXV* reached its apogee , made a sudden adjustment , and began plummeting toward Europa . Seventeen minutes ago the satellite went full blast on its reverse thrusters , releasing the tungsten rod and allowing its inertia ( and Europa 's gravity ) to pull it to the surface . Once the rod hit the icy surface , it was falling at something like 22,300 kilometers per hour ; the force of the impact pushed it through seven kilometers of ice ( the thinnest portion we could realistically hit ) , then it plummeted through about 3 kilometers of water before slowly sinking 99 more kilometers to the bottom of the ocean . The impact was significant , enough so that the other twenty-four satellites could measure the shockwave through the ocean below the ice . If the shockwave hit something more dense than the surrounding water , it 'd slow down ; if it hit something less dense , it 'd speed up . Simple . But there was still 76 minutes before the shockwave completely travelled around Europa , so we sat back and checked all the systems for the hundredth time today . `` Hold on ... yeah , something 's come up already . '' We turned to face Hauptman 's station . It was obvious what she was looking at : an oval patch of extremely dense materials , a bright red shape on a green background . Then two more . Then five or six , all ovular but of different lengths . Suddenly the signal cut out . `` Comms ! '' Andersdottir shouted . Gonzales-Smith rushed back to his station , turning a number of dials and throwing a headset over his ears . `` Captain , there 's some sort of signal stepping all over our broadcast . I 'm reading multiple sources , intermittent . Triangulating now ... . '' We watched as he typed in a command and stared at his screen . `` Ma'am , they 're ... coming from Europa ... . '' `` Multiple sources ? '' Andersdottir asked . `` Can you filter them out ? '' Gonzales-Smith shook his head . `` Too strong . They 're overpowering our satellites , and -- hold on -- okay , they 've all stopped , data stream is back online . '' We turned back to Hauptman 's montitor . There was a thick black stripe where the shockwave had been moving during the interruption . Naturally , the data would be stored on the satellites ; it was just a matter of retrieving them later . But to our amazement , there were now hundreds of circles , perfect circles , all congregated in a dozen clusters . `` How big are those ? '' I asked . Hauptman circled one with his finger , then tapped twice on the screen . The computer began measuring the diameters of each circle . `` Program says between 21 and 22 kilometers , average 21.45 kilometers in diameter . Density around 11,000 kilos per cubic meter . That 's as dense as lead , maybe a touch less . '' `` So huge spheres of lead-like materials scattered across Europa 's oceans , '' Andersdottir said to no one in particular . `` Is it possible that it 's a settlement of some type ? Like a European city of sorts ? '' I shrugged my shoulders ; hypotheticals were n't my thing . `` I do n't think so , '' Gonzales-Smith exclaimed after a moment 's thought . `` Those ovals we saw initially : I think those were spheres , too . But as the shockwave approached , they started moving ; the computer registered the movement because it was a pocket of density . It could n't predict movement , right ? '' We all stared at him , wondering if he was correct . If they were moving ... . `` Well , '' Hauptman interjected , `` we 'll see when the shockwave returns . There 's enough power that it 'll reverberate back to the point of origin and still be picked up by the satellites . '' And sure enough , as the second data set began coming in , there were the same hundreds of spheres , all huddled in groups near the north pole of the moon . `` Lots of movement , '' Hauptman said as he pulled up the initial picture . Sure enough , most of the spheres had shifted slightly ; strangely , none had migrated from one group to another . `` Are they ships of some sort ? '' Tanaka asked . `` Maybe submarines ? And are they broadcasting that signal ? '' `` Well , I do n't know about ships , '' Gonzales-Smith replied quietly , `` but I 've been running triangulation , and all the signals come from sphere groups . '' `` Here 's the thing , '' Hauptman said , pointing at the screen . `` They 're all quite dense , perfectly spherical , *ja* ? And they 're also all resting at the bottom of the ocean on the seabed . Obviously . No movement , very uniform sizes , capable of producing signals when affected by the shockwave . '' She stared at us all for a moment , then frowned . `` It 's possible that they 're eggs . '' `` Bullshit ! '' Tanaka shouted . `` There 's no way ! If they 're eggs , what laid them ? Something would 've appeared on the monitors , yeah ? '' `` Most likely , '' I said . `` Unless they 're exactly as dense as the water . '' Hauptman nodded his head . `` These satellites could tell the difference between olive oil and canola oil . '' `` So then they ca n't be eggs , right ? '' `` They could be , '' Andersdottir replied , her voice trembling . `` If the parent was interplantary . '' Tanaka scoffed . `` Now we 're stretching things , '' he said brusquely . `` We collect data , and the eggheads back on Earth do the hypotheticals , right ? '' `` I 'm with Tanaka , '' I said with a sigh . `` It 's a headscratcher , no doubt , but let 's get the data from the satellites and move on to Titan . '' Everyone nodded in agreement . `` Alright , we 're going to begin extraction of the data , then Tanaka 's going to program the satellites ' journey to Titan . T-minus three days until we break orbit , okay ? '' Just then , a number of alarms began blaring at Gonzales-Smith 's station . He threw on a set of headphones and watched his monitor . `` Ma'am , the signal 's back , '' he said breathlessly . `` Pretty strong , too ; it could fry out the satellites ' receivers . '' `` Switch to emergency band , order them to harden for the next six hours . '' Gonzales-Smith shook his head . `` Signal 's covering the emergency band ... . '' he turned a few dials . `` I could send it on UHF three ; that 's clear , but the instructions will take about twenty minutes at that low a frequency . '' `` Do it anyways , '' Andersdottir barked . `` And see if you can turn them away from those damned spheres ! '' Gonzales-Smith nodded , then paused for a moment . His face drained , becoming pale and sickly . `` Ma'am , '' he said shakily , his voice trembling with fear , `` the signal 's not coming from Europa .

I did n't know how long I was to be there , but the feeling was nLIB . `` Are you going to go ? '' the man asked . I asked . He nodded . `` Will you go to that day ? '' he asked . And I nodded .

Grabbing a towel and throwing my soaked t-shirt into the hamper , I headed out to the showers . Ever had that feeling you had everyone looking at you ? I could feel the judgement , but some people felt compelled to make some remarks . `` Holy Shit . '' `` Dude ... '' At that point I ran towards the shower .

As Pa chambered his Remington 870 , I could n't help but speak up in protest . `` Wait ! '' I yelled . Pa lowered his gun , clearly annoyed by the interruption . `` Why does she have to die ? ! Why ca n't we just set her free and let her live the rest of her life as she pleases ? '' `` You know we ca n't do that . Besides , what we she even do ? This old crow would n't make it a week without us . '' `` How can you know that ? ! You 've never let one free before ! '' `` Well shit , if you 're so convinced why do n't you just fucking ask her ? Go ahead , see if she has any glorious plans for the future . '' I looked over at Becca , she had n't said a single word . Pa had apparently trained her well . Still , I had to try . I *had* to get an answer . Surely , there was something she wanted do , at the very least there was no way she wanted to die . `` Come on , Becca . Would n't you rather go free ? You could do whatever you wanted , whenever you wanted . Would n't you like that ? '' I asked , in the softest voice I could , so as not to startle her . `` moo . '' BLAM ! ! !

This letter has been sent to confirm that my office has formally received and processed the Present ’ s letter requesting to receive periodic economic updates on the state of House of Representative ’ s latest economic stimulus bill intended to boost the United States economy and to avert recession . We have successfully formed a committee of 11 members to monitor and review its progress and to release official publications from the Federal Reserve to the press . In addition I shall , at the President ’ s request , delivery personal memos citing economic recommendations as we transition into Q2 . Regards , Janet Yellen Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W . Washington , D.C. 20551 P : ( 202 ) 974-7008 E : janet.yellen @ us.gov DBNR ——— APRIL 4 , 2017 Secretary of State 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW , Washington , DC 20500 Dear Madam Secretary , Please deliver to the President of the United States this letter containing a summary and analysis of the economic state of the United States of America . The initial stimulus has been disseminated . It has had the initial expected effect of producing a marked rise in the rate of inflation by 2.4 % . This is due to the printing and borrowing of money needed to finance the economic stimulus in the short-run . Economic analysis committees have projected that based on Census data , National Birth rates and Retirement statistics , 688 Billion USD would be needed for 2017 Q1 - Q4 . The borrowing of this has acted to weaken the US dollar globally . This however is expected to be offset by a subsequent rise in GDP , business investment , and net exports . Regards , Janet Yellen Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W . Washington , D.C. 20551 P : ( 202 ) 974-7008 E : janet.yellen @ us.gov DBNR ——— JUNE 22 , 2017 Secretary of State 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW , Washington , DC 20500 Dear Madam Secretary , Please deliver to the President of the United States this letter containing a summary and analysis of the economic state of the United States of America . The initial stimulus is currently in Phase 2 . As predicted higher overall national spending has led to an increase in GDP and private sector investment as younger markets tend to spend more than their older counterparts instead of saving for the future . This is acted to increase the national GDP and has lifted the strength of the dollar overseas . The Federal Reserve has also instituted a step policy by which the stimulus packages are being released in batches in order to throttle inflation and prevent a glut of money supply in the markets . There have been reports of increases in litigation as some parents attempt to hold in trust the stimulus on behalf of their children , some against their wishes . These are isolated and not expected to increase . Regards , Janet Yellen Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W . Washington , D.C. 20551 P : ( 202 ) 974-7008 E : janet.yellen @ us.gov DBNR ——— SEPTEMBER 22 , 2017 Secretary of State 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW , Washington , DC 20500 Dear Madam Secretary , Please deliver to the President of the United States this letter containing a summary and analysis of the economic state of the United States of America . The initial stimulus is currently in Phase 3 . The overall positive effect of the stimulus has been retarded by the wealth re-distribution caused by the older-biased workforce . While the initial spending of the youth demographic acted to bolster the economy in terms of an overall rise in GDP , because of the disproportionate wealth to income ( most are outside of the workforce , unemployed , or in jobs making less that 15,000 USD per year ) , this demographic overall has not had the ability to sustain its high level of discretionary spending for any prolonged period of time . Most notably , when the stimulus package has been exhausted , the wealth returns to their older counterparts who possess the skills and knowledge to provide the good and services that the younger markets were initially paying to own and use . This older demographic is more inclined to save overall and reduce the money supply recirculating . Forecasts indicate that within a few economic periods the economy will return to its pre-stimulus state . Regards , Janet Yellen Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W . Washington , D.C. 20551 P : ( 202 ) 974-7008 E : janet.yellen @ us.gov DBNR ——— DECEMBER 18 , 2017 Secretary of State 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW , Washington , DC 20500 Dear Madam Secretary , Please deliver to the President of the United States this letter containing a summary and analysis of the economic state of the United States of America . GDP has fallen back to pre-stimulus levels as businesses are experiencing an economic downturn due to the absence of its previously bolstering young market demographics . Businesses are selling off excess latent capital previously needed during the higher demand of the early part of the economic stimulus and instituting layoffs due to the decreased demand and production . It was the Federal Reserve ’ s policy to suggest repayment of the national deficit during the times of higher GDP which has nearly offset the borrowing for the stimulus . The Federal Reserve will be lowering interest rates in the coming months to encourage spending and prevent another recession .

He sighed deeply frustrated by the chaos he and his department was being put through . “ Captain , have you found anything in your sector ? ” the radio buzzed . “ Nothing interesting in my area ” Captain Dereks responded back into the mic . In the distance , he could see the helicopter surveying the other side of the lake trying to figure out where the next body could be . The past couple days had been absolute hell for him and everyone in the forestry department . Search and rescues were nothing new to him or his team but this one was different because they had the FBI on the asses while being kept completely in the dark . In the past few months it was discovered that the oil paintings done by famed TV Bob Ross were real locations but bodies were being found too . Three bodies later and no one could ever say this was just a coincidence but it was rumored that every single body found was charred and had looked like a Hiroshima bombing victim . A serial killer arsonist with a flair for the arts sounded too bizarre to be true but the government mandated lock down was no joke . Thankfully the arsonist kept his flames under control without setting the forest ablaze but burning bodies in the open wilderness didn ’ t make any sense at all to him . Dereks stopped once again to stare at the tall trees around him trying to make sense of the whole operation . Maddox Silvens was their designated babysitter from the FBI taking over his park and that was the only clear thing he got from Silvens because any other information about the operation was too high above his paygrade . It was unsettling to him that he couldn ’ t get any more information about why his park was next but at least the media wasn ’ t here to bother him or his department . He knew it was only a matter of time before the chaos of the media would arrive when words gets out that federal agents are focusing on his park . Every single park in the country was closed and from talking with other park rangers his seemed to be the one getting most of the unwanted government attention . “ Amanda , any update on what we ’ re looking for ? ” he spoke into his walkie talkie . “ Were just about done going through all of Bob Ross ’ paintings and we have narrowed it down to about 30 paintings from the show that could look like our park , ” replied Amanda . “ Should we start looking at other works outside of the show ? ” Dereks thought for a moment “ No Amanda , were already searching this blindly for a possible needle in a haystack . I ’ m going to start heading back soon and we can over what you and Jason have narrowed it down to. ” Just then the park ranger spotted something just beyond the trees moving . He raced over cautiously hoping not to run into something dangerous . In the clearing there was a barely clothed man groaning and trying in vain to get himself up . “ SIR ARE OKAY ? ! ” he yelled out running towards the helpless man . “ My name is Park Ranger Dereks and I am here to help . How long have you been lost in the forest ? ” Derreks examined the man but he didn ’ t appear to be hurt , just week from exhaustion . There were no active orders for a missing person but judging by his raggedy condition it looked like he had been out here for a while . He moved the long hair out of the mans face but he couldn ’ t understand what he was trying to say . “ Sir save your energy , help is on the way. ” Reaching into his bag he grabbed a flare gun and shot it into the air . “ Amanda , Ive found an exhausted hiker and I need a medical airlift. ” “ Roger that Sir . Medic has spotted your flare and help is on the way ” responded Amanda “ Run ” the lost hiker weezed in his feeble state . “ I cant do that sir , help will be here any moment ” the deep look of concern on the man ’ s face puzzled Dereks . He also couldn ’ t help but think the face looked familiar , was he a local , a frequent guest… . Dereks stared a little more “ YOU ’ RE BOB R -- - “ but before he could finish the man he was holding became extremely hot and burned his hands . “ Run ! ” the mysterious man said one last time but it was too late . The incoming helicopter saw the bright flash of light from above and stayed hovering in place . Silvens and his partner were up the hill and not far behind and saw it happen . “ FUCK !

I don ’ t know where we went wrong ” “ I don ’ t care just fix it ! We can ’ t afford to lose another so tell the nerds back at HQ to get their shit straight or I will personally shove my foot up their collective asses ! Now lets move onto the next one before this tracts any unwarranted attention. ” The helicopter had landed safely nearby and Silven had picked up his smashed radio before heading back into the chopper with his partner . Back at camp Amanda looked at the entrance to the park and saw a group of vans approaching the gate . “ Im sorry guys but were closed right now ” Amanda had yelled at the group of white vans . They didn ’ t listen and the vans parked in their position . A man in a suit emerged from the leading vehicle and approached her . “ Ma ’ am Im Agent Stottles with the Department of Homeland Security . I need to speak with you Director so we can begin our work here ” “ I ’ m sorry sir but My director is busy tending to a lost hiker he found but I can direct you to the FBI agent that has taken over before you got here. ” “ FBI ? ” Stottles looked confused to Amanda and she saw the other vans turn around and peel off . The driver of his van poked his head out and yelled “ Sir ! We need to go , the target is on the move ” Without so much as saying another word he ran back to the van and they drove off . Amanda ran back to her radio to get ahold of her Director “ Sir , what is your location ? I need to talk to you when you ’ re back on camp. ”': '5 5 5 5 5', \"`` Yeah , like it would stop me .

He 'd certainly never been on the bulbous bridge of an elven capital ship , with towering synthglass panels on all sides curving up impossibly and meeting a hundred feet above his head . The view out the front of the bridge made his stomach pinch . There they were : the Pillars of Creation , close enough to fill his entire field of view , gold and fluffy and immeasurably , unbearably huge . `` It is a gift ! '' shouted Boromir , the headstrong eldest son of Gondor 's king . `` A gift to the foes of Mordor . Why not use this ring ? '' Frodo eyed the ring . It sat , gleaming dully , atop the plinth in the center of the bridge where he 'd placed it a minute ago . Releasing it from his possession had left him with the most queasy feeling , his bones transformed to rubber . `` You can not wield it , '' said Aragorn , sitting back , still wrapped in the Star Ranger 's dark green coat that accompanied him everywhere . `` None of us can . The Ring answers to Sauron alone . '' Frodo would have sworn that the ring shone brighter for a moment when Aragorn pronounced its master 's name . Ah , Space Christ . This was no place for a hobbit . Frodo 's people were wayfarers , nomads . Life in zero G had left them smaller and more compact than these towering land-dwelling specimens . A hobbit 's bones were short and stout , though not as thick or durable as a dwarf 's . It was an excess of gravity that led to the stocky stature of the dwarves , who made their living excavating deep beneath the surface of dense metal planets . It was the dwarves , thought Frodo , with whom he identified most closely . Simple , proud people who made an honest living , without any of the high-tech dalliances of the elves , or the unblinking arrogance of the pure-humans . If you 'd told Frodo two weeks ago that he would be here , right now , his mates Sam and Merry and Pippin taking a tour of the engine room , and him standing on the bridge himself , surrounded by the galaxy 's most important people -- he would have told you to shove it up your exhaust pipe . Their ship had barely made it from the Shire in one piece , hounded as they were by the silent black frigates that Gandalf said were piloted by Sauron 's top commanders . If not for the assistance of Aragorn , who 'd guided them from jump point to jump point in his muted silver corsair Anduril , and even fended off the Black Riders alone for a few minutes while Frodo and the others dealt with an overheated hyperdrive , they would be nothing but molecules floating , miles apart , through the dead , empty vacuum . What brought Frodo 's attention back to the discussion at hand was the sudden movement of Gimli , one of the dwarves , who lunged out of his seat , violet light-axe crackling to life , and brought the sizzling blade down on the ring with all the force his burly arms could muster . There was a searing screech , and a crack , as the light-axe scoured a deep rut into the plinth . The ring , struck full force , simply scooted a few inches to the side and arrested itself . `` Oh , great , '' said Legolas , the snootiest elf Frodo had ever met . `` Typical dwarf . '' Before Gimli could respond , Elrond rose to his feet , extending a hand that silenced everyone at once . `` The Ring can not be destroyed , Gimli , son of Gloin , by any craft that we here possess , '' said Elrond , his voice assuming a supremely patronizing tone that Frodo prayed was unintentional . `` The Ring , '' continued Elrond , `` was made in the fires of the galaxy 's core . Only there can it be unmade . It must be taken deep into Mordor and cast back into the supermassive black hole from whence it came . '' Acrid smoke rose up from the ruined plinth 's black gash . The smell -- like an overclocked supercomputer thinking itself to death -- seemed out of place on the glittering bridge . `` One of you , '' said Elrond , `` must do this . '' The words hung in the air , fat and unpleasant . `` One does not simply fly into Mordor , '' said Boromir after a while . `` Its systems are guarded by more than just orcs . There is evil there that does not sleep , and the great eye is ever watchful . It 's a barren wasteland , riddled with fire and ash and dust . Not with a fleet of ten thousand carriers could you do this . '' `` Did you hear nothing Lord Elrond said ? '' shouted Legolas , leaping to his feet , his long blond hair billowing . `` The Ring must be destroyed ! '' `` And I suppose you think you 're the one to do it , '' said Gimli . In a flash they were all bickering , even Gandalf , who Frodo had never taken for the argumentative type . Normally Frodo would have enjoyed this -- not every day did the highest and mightiest dwellers of the universe embarrass themselves in front of a humble Hobbit -- but for some reason he 'd developed a thrumming , red-hot headache . After a while their shouts and sneers became too much for him to stand . `` Ah , fuck , '' he shouted , `` I 'll take the damn thing . '' Everyone stopped -- Legolas even left his mouth hanging open mid-insult -- and stared at him . `` The condition is that you all have to shut up , though , '' grumbled Frodo .\": '5 5 5 5 5', \"`` So you know , '' she said , `` I was thinking about it .

The ups and downs in his tones and the way he moved his mouth was both terrifying and fascinating . ~~~ After introducing his men and 4 of their closest relatives by name ( as was custom ) , the High Priest launched into a monologue of how things were going to change , how fantastic it would be to have such power finally on their side , etc , too lost in dreams to let the arrival speak just yet . ~~~ This guy sure could talk .

I love dragons ! : D Tears streaked from the corners of Edmund ’ s eyes , the beating of Raven ’ s gargantuan wings along with her rapid descent created so much wind that he could hardly take in a breath . His legs held fast to her scaled neck , his lithe body pressed close . Horns sharp enough to impale a man protruding from the back of her skull served as his hand holds as they banked . The tips of Raven ’ s claws skimmed the water before she reared up , throwing her hind legs forward into a jolting landing onto the beach . Edmund clambered down onto the sand and sprawled out , enjoying the sun-heated earth and the rays beating down on him . Raven was in a similar state . He had to chuckle at how similar they had become . He wondered who she would choose to fly with her when he was dead and gone , and felt a sudden pang of sharp jealousy . Would they call her Raven ? He thought back on the day he first saw her , flying high above the pastures he grew up on , circling in search of a fat calf or a grazing buck . He had thought she was an enormous black bird . Lower and lower she flew , Edmund frozen in fear as what he thought was a raven grew in size before his eyes into an enormous reptile , tar black scales each catching the sunlight , gleaming . She landed before him , snatching up a lamb into her jaws and engulfing it . She was regal , and terrifying . Her knowing eyes bored into him , considering . Edmund stood stock-still for what seemed an era , awaiting those jaws to crunch his bones . Who would harvest the grain this year ? Who would cut the wood for winter ? A thousand such trifles cascaded through his mind as he awaited death . The dragon took one step forward , then another . Edmund felt his soul exposed , a level of nudity he had never experienced . At last she stood before him , her reptilian stench filling all his senses , and she lowered her head . Fear coursed through Edmund ’ s body as his hand moved on its own accord , gliding over the intricate scaling on her brow . He felt more than heard her words . *Mine . *': '5 5 5 5 5', \"`` Get up ! '' A voice thundered in the cryogenic chamber . The steel vent opened and the chilling gas that was shrouding me for god-knows-how-long was being sucked out from the chamber of mine . I rolled my eyes upward . Nov. 03016. , the green neon light flickered . I gazed at the numbers once more : 3,016 . Three thousand and sixteen , huh . You could say I 've been waiting to hear that words for eight hundred years . Did humanity really took eight hundred years to find cure for nano-machine viral infection ? I pondered . I guess the nanos were pushing the boundary of the laws of physics , but I did not expect to take it so long . Also , I thought to myself , these future employee of Cryo Corp. could learn to be a bit more polite . `` I said get up ! '' a voice thundered once more . He sure was impatient . Or was it the case that the culture of future is being rude to your patrons ? I shook the frost chips off my body and began to breath manually . I squeezed my lungs to get the last puff of cryogenic gas out from my system . Although I was a bit saddened at the thought that my family would be long gone by now , but I was prepared . In fact , the anticipation of experiencing the future was racing my heart . `` Fuckin ' get up ! '' A voice rang . A wooden stock of rifle shattered the glass of the cryogenic chamber and hit my stomach . The shards of glasses made several cuts on my arms . I groaned in pain as I vainly attempted to cover up the wounds . A big gloved hand reached me and grabbed me by the collar . The hand pulled me out of the cryogenic chamber and threw me on the dusty ground of the cryogenic chamber room . Dusty ? I ran my bleeding finger against the tile of the room . Dirt and dust and some sort of insect shells all over the floor . `` I will say this for the last damn time . Get . Up . '' said the man of the hand . He had a rifle resting on his shoulder and a thick black gas mask on his face . I reluctantly got up to my feet . I started to cough up the last bit of the cryogenic gas as I patiently waited for what was up . The man was humming to himself and reading through my patient profiles . I was going to ask what happened with the Cryo Corp. but was too intimidated to ask . Even if the future is paradise and all , I doubted he broke through the chamber glass with a good intention . `` Ah , yes , yes ... These ... match up ! '' the man mumbled to himself . He tucked the profile papers under his arm pit and pointed the rifle toward me . `` Now walk , meat bag . '' I raised my hand up and started to walk toward wherever he was pointing . The cryogenic room was in shambles . More than half the chambers were broken and looted , and fluorescent light of the ceiling of the room was out . It seemed like all the cryogenic chambers were running on the emergency batteries as I was told several centuries ago . Outside , about two dozen men in black uniform trench coats and same kind of gas masks on their face awaited both of us . `` Boss ! '' said the man with the rifle behind me , `` We 've got a match ! '' The two dozen men started to separate into two groups and revealed a man sitting on a chair behind them . He alone was donned in red . As he raised himself up from the chair , the men in black knelt before him . The man in red , who seemed to be the leader of the group , opened his arm in welcome and said : `` Ah , my liver . '' His liver . The men in red also stepped away from the hallway and led me to a room . An operating room . In the room , stood a 9-feet hunched giant covered in white rags holding a tray of surgical knives . He was spraying some liquid on them . In the corner of the room , a pile of corpses turned inside out laid dead . I recognized few of them . They all had the same nano-machine viral infection like I did .

Poor thing , bless her soul . I told her to go back to sleep , and she did . I dragged the body and put it in the back of the old pick-up , after that it was a short snowy drive to the lake . I have a warehouse there , it 's a place I could *work* at . I prepared the saws , and tongs . I cut out a decent sized hole in the ice , and pulled the body close so I could tie the anchor to his feet . I toss the anchor in , the sound the chain makes as drags over the ice , into the depths of the waters is chilling to the bone .

Glancing once more behind her , she stepped into the Temple of Ages , the stone slabs swinging shut behind her . *The Temple of Ages - an homage to the Old Gods , divine beings that granted Their chosen warriors powers beyond any mere mortal . Countless wars were fought in Their name , and countless people died to sate Their bloodlust . * Catarin could n't help but stare in awe at what stood before her . A grand hall of white marble stretched out before her , seemingly unending . Jewels and gems , silver and gold and platinum lie unmolested in ornate filigree . Crystal chandeliers hang suspended from nothing , flickering light fracturing and scattering into the darkened corners of the corridor . *Surely this hall could n't fit in the Temple , * thought Catarin , *for the plateau upon which it stands is barely large enough to support the Temple itself . This hall should have broken off from the building and fallen into the Abyss . * *None truly knows from whence it came . Some time after the Fall of the Ieryssi Empire , scholars believe , the Old Gods placed the Temple of Ages upon what was then called the Abyssal Spire . A singular column of volcanic rock juts out from the bottomless Abyss , and at its top sits the Temple . * Reminding herself of her purpose here , Catarin strode forth into the impossibly long hall . Beautiful tapestries lined the walls , depicting ancient battles and long-passed conquests . Beneath each saga , the artifact of legend stood , seeming to wait for its next champion . Catarin walked briskly past each weapon , never giving any more than a passing glance . *Excalibur , the legendary sword that Artur used to fell the armies of Myrdr . Mjolnir , the holy warhammer that Thor Odinsson wielded in his conquest of the North . The Horn of Yeshua , which razed the walls of Ierysalm itself long ago . Many have flocked to the Temple of Ages hoping to find their glory . * Catarin stepped lightly , trying her best to not disturb the dead as she moved steadily toward her charge . Bones littered the beautiful marble floor , the bleached skeletons of would-be warriors and desperate fools . Catarin knew better than to reach for one of the Old Gods ' gifts . *Pitiful , * she thought , *thinking Them anything other than fickle . * *There is only one way to reach the Temple of Ages , and that is via the bridge . The Temple stands in the middle of a bottomless chasm , an ancient volcano that has long been dormant . The bridge is no easy task to maneuver , though . It is as old as the Temple itself , and has long been rotted and frayed . * All the weapons were shining examples of ornate design , extravagant beauty and breathless wonder . All but one . Catarin stood before the altar , winded and feeling older than she began . Calloused hands lowered the cloth wraps from her face , and golden locks fell in waves as she gazed toward the image above her . *It is the First , and it will be the Last . You are the only one who can rightfully take it up , Catarin . It 's up to you to save us . * It was a crudely drawn picture . Two figures in shades of sanguine reds and earthen browns , standing in resolution . Two figures , strengthened in their fraternity . Two figures , standing in opposition . One figure , standing above the broken body of his brother . *Only you can save them , * the First whispered to her , *and I can give you the power to do it . * ... Catarin Ierys , Empress of Ruins , stared toward the Temple of Ages with a righteous fury . Its blackened facade seemed to laugh at her from atop the Spire , a cacophony of mockery that crawled beneath her skin . With a disgusted sneer , she took hold of the weapon she had traveled so far to obtain and hacked away at the moorings of the bridge . The sharpened rock sawed through the ropes with minimal effort , and within moments the rickety bridge was falling . She watched with satisfaction as it sank into the darkened depths of the Abyss . And Catarin turned and began the long journey home to kill her sister .\": '4 4 5 5 5', \"`` The Empire spans galaxies and seeds planets with families . They fight each other wholesale .

I promise , '' she added , in an attempt to sound convincing . My gaze had been settled blankly on a dark patch of ceiling . The bedroom was pitch black with the only illumination emanating from the alarm clock . I spun to face away from her , silent , emotions whirling in my head like a tornado of confusion . `` I know , '' I muttered mostly to placate her , but I knew this would not be the end of it . She reached up her hand to place on my arm . The warmth of her touch , previously so comforting , felt tainted . Instinctively I had retreated from this contact , but immediately I knew this was a mistake . She sat up swiftly . `` Is that really still bothering you so much ? '' Her voice was indignant , and her tone quite elevated from the whispers she had been employing prior . `` I told you , I do n't care about what you 've done . You should forgive yourself , too , and quit letting your self-prescribed penance become a burden on those who care for you . '' There was another brief moment of quiet , and she let out a sigh of exasperation . `` I just ... I do n't know what to do . '' That was the second of the three lies . She leaned over me in the blackness of the bed , placing a hand on each side of my silhouette . I could feel her weight shifting around , and when it had stopped , she was whispering once more . `` Wo n't you answer me ? '' I could n't find the words . I knew , deep down , that her desire to stay with me was not her own ; she believed even deep down that it was , but she was not aware enough to understand that obligation is not the foundation of a lasting relationship . We had built our lives around each other for so many years , and out of some desperation I had let my good fortune blind me to what I truly yearned for . Having her around had helped me alleviate my sense of worthlessness , but in recent days I had found that outside affirmation was only a crutch that I could not rely on forever . I had to seek comfort in my own actions , and know that what I was doing was what *I* wanted ; I had followed through with these urges , and some of them had been , as she put it , 'morally questionable . ' When the minutes passed and I had failed to answer her , she climbed out of the bed . I could hear the faint rustling sounds of her getting dressed , but I made no move to stop her . She made her way to the bedroom door , but paused before she could grasp the handle . It was as though leaving now would signify something awful that had been brewing in the back of her mind , like a wild animal she was hiding in the broom closet that would claw and scratch and howl until it could no longer be ignored . She eventually grasped the handle and pulled the door open ever so slightly . With a brief glance and a crack in her voice that sounded as though she was suppressing a sob , I could make out the words `` ... be back shortly . '' The next morning as I gazed in horror at the wreckage that had been her car , mangled and sundered in the accident that had occurred the night before , my brain tore itself apart . All the emotions I had been feeling up to this point were entirely replaced with guilt . The voices of the policemen and paramedics that offered words of consolation and sympathy washed right over me . The din of the scene was distant , and I heard only the echo of her final words clearly in my head . `` Be right back , '' she had said . It was then that I encountered the horrible revelation that those words had been her third , and final , lie .\": '5 5 5 5 5', \"`` The baby was born .

Many bottles of champagne were popped over the creation of the project and now , both parallel universes had nothing to do but wait as WALDO silently carried out its sole purpose . `` Dunnigan , where 's WALDO at ? '' Originally meant as a joke from his supervisor , the question became a source of frustration for both as days turned to weeks and weeks turned to months . Media interest had already moved on to a famous celebrity divorce , as WALDO continued its process diligently with no end in sight . `` Well , sir , same as yesterday . No change in activity levels .

But the explosive shell had annihilated the trench , and all the soldiers inside . Finally , one appeared , flailing and crying into the dirt .

His peach-fuzzed cheek pressed into the gory mud . The mere sight of his neck riled me up , but I forced the cravings down .

He did n't sound quite like himself . `` Atten , everything okay ? '' I asked in a lowered tone , taking a step closer to him . Damnable insects swooped down at my face , biting and stinging . I managed to smack one , and watched with vicious satisfaction as it slammed into a nearby tree trunk and then dropped , stunned , to the forest floor . I returned my attention back to my guide . After years alongside Attenib , I knew his moods well , recognized the minor twitches of the muscles beneath his nut-brown skin . I 'd worked with him long enough to trust in his uncanny ability to know just where to dig . But now , today , he looked nervous , pale despite his leathery , tanned hide . And when he looked back at me , I saw a glint of unexpected emotion in his eyes . Fear . `` Is this the wrong place to dig ? '' I asked again . I stood near him , almost shoulder to shoulder despite the oppressive , humid heat of the jungle . I 'd called a halt , so our porters huddled several steps behind , taking shelter in the shade of a large palm . Again , Attenib shook his head . `` Right place , '' he said softly . `` But wrong feeling . Not good to dig here . '' I took a moment to weigh his words . I truly believed that Attenib appreciated our arrangement , that he harbored no resentment towards my ownership of him . After all , I 'd treated him far better than his fellows , snapped up on the bidding block to work the fields until their muscles and bodies failed them . But I 'd seen his talent , and he 'd served me well . But we sat on our laurels too long , as I basked in the attention of the Royal Society and failed to note the new naturalists nipping at my heels . I 'd secured the funding for this expedition , but one of the Senior Fellows had drawn me aside and warned me that , without results , it would be my last . I looked again at Attenib . Did he know the conflict in my head ? He just looked back , waiting . I made my decision . `` Men ! Gather your tools ! '' I shouted to the hired porters . `` You lot ! Axes , to clear the area ! You others , picks and shovels ! This is the spot ! '' Attenib said nothing , but I saw him shrink back towards the camp . I should have disciplined him , I knew , but I chose to let him go . I had a dig to supervise . And soon , Attenib 's almost supernatural talent proved itself once again , as one of the porters let out a cry of surprise . `` Sah ! Over here ! '' I hurried over to the man , roughly pushing him aside before he could damage the delicate artifact . But my words died away as I stared , open mouthed , at the object . Silver metal , curved , suggesting a large cylinder . Rivets in regular lines showed where the plates were anchored together . A hatch , the glass obscured with dust and dirt . And a logo of some sort , a square of blue with white dots , next to red and white stripes . It looked like a flag , albeit one I 'd never seen before . `` What is it ? '' I asked , utterly confused . From nearby , Attenib let out another soft moan . `` Evil , '' he answered me . `` Not from this place . It does n't belong . '' I bent closer , wiping away more dirt . I saw words , now , stamped on the metal . `` Apollo , '' I read . `` What could that be ? '' Unnoticed , Attenib shrank back , in amid the trees that reminded him of his childhood when he 'd laughed and run between their trunks . His master continued to puzzle over the alien thing that he 'd felt in the ground , but Attenib could stand here no longer . With other objects , he felt their history . That drew him to those hidden beneath the earth , feeling for their long histories , disrupted but to be resumed once unearthed . It became almost beyond notice , the history of all around him , all he touched . But this object had no history at all .

So , it was a brisk autumn evening . The sun had just set and the golden leaves of the trees around me were settling down for a good night 's sleep . I do n't know why , but I had decided on that particular evening to go to a park and sit on a bench to think . Eventually , the park 's lamps turned on and I sat there , watching as couples of all kinds walked by . At one point , I remember sighing to myself and relaxing a bit , and then ... well , it was much later in the night . I had fallen asleep . I 'm actually not certain what time it was , but I was certain of one thing : I had to pee . I mean , I had so much urine-pressure built up , I could hardly think straight , let alone walk any distance comfortably . The trouble was that the lamps in the part had turned off and clouds now covered the sky . I had no way to navigate to the nearest bathroom , but I had to try . I drew a mental picture in my mind of where I was before I dozed off and where I needed to go . After I was fairly certain I had every detail in my head , I nodded and rose to my feet . The urine in my intestines sloshed back and forth . I could feel the floodgates about to open , but I had to carry forward ! I took a large step and tried to discern the precise distance I could go before the worst case scenario . No matter how I sliced it , I would not make it in time . So I ran . I ran as fast as I could in the darkness of night to the position the washroom should have been . Like all other faulty plans , this one failed abruptly as I ran into a tree . I fell flat on my back before feeling it . Warm liquid oozing all over my lower half . I did n't make it . For the first time in my adult life , I wet myself . At least there was no one to see , right ? I thought I could even make it home without anyone knowing . Boy was I wrong . I know it sounds weird , but at about midstream , I had the idea of unzipping my fly and peeing away from my person . It made a good amount of sense to me at the time , so I did . The problem was , I had no idea how much urine was still in my system . Some time as I was nearing the end of my urine-fountain , my pee began to glow . All of it began to glow . I mean , there was a little green glowing river starting from me and moving in every direction . In the light of my urine , I noticed that a homeless man was on the other side of the tree . To this day , I could not tell you the emotions painted on his face . Then I hear it , `` Oh ! HAIL NO ! '' What ? `` I see water . I come here , and what do I see ? '' A rather obese woman , about a foot tall then appeared out of nowhere . `` I see a hobo and a boy who peed himself in public . And NO ! It DOES N'T MATTER that it is the middle of the night , boy ! How did you even get yo nasty-ass piss all over the place ? '' To be clear , I thought I was dreaming . `` Look here boy . You are the 'Chosen one ' . I 'm s'posed to grant you a wish , and you 's supposed save people ... and here you are covered in yo own piss ! How 's dat ? '' `` Look . '' I say , `` If you really are going to grant me a wish , then I want a super power . '' `` Good . Here . '' She gave me a little necklace . `` Wear dis . It 'll give you power . '' Then she was gone . I do n't really understand what happened that night or what my new necklace was supposed to do ... but I 'm still peeing , and it still glows . I mean , seriously , where is all this urine coming from ? I am like a spring of urine . On the plus side , I have created a perpetual energy machine by peeing directly into a water wheel .

Love , Achike Abasad , Prince of Nigeria I was furious when I received the email . I had just posted a picture on my Facebook page of my cousin and I together at a beach in California . This `` Prince '' , this scammer , had clearly been looking through my personal page and tried to use my cousin against me , staining my memory of the beautiful California sun on my back . Had he *really* thought that I would n't ask my cousin before I gave him *any* money ? So though my better judgement advised against extending the interaction , I sent him an angry email in return . He responded . Ms. Lianne , You have discovered me . I am a poor scammer working out of a crumbling office in Nigeria , and the only way I could contact you was through a scam .

I saw a set of crooked white teeth smiling before he leaned back from the camera and allowed me to see his whole face . His cheeks were hollow and concave and his hair was lank , but despite this I could see the seeds of attraction . He opened his mouth to speak , but before he did , a nasal voice spoke in heavily accented English from the background . `` You have n't messaged the rich woman yet ? You always were the best in the business , Achike . Having the smart to sell her that love symbol garbage- inspired . Really . Inspired . '' Achike 's face grew more tight with every word . His face flashed with anger as he stared at a location offscreen , only to disappear to a mask of panic . `` It is n't true ! '' Achike said . `` Is just what I told the boss ! The love is true !

The aliens were a group of humans that had invaded Earth . They were the first to attack , and they were the only ones to do so . The first few years of the invasion were a disaster . The people were at first terrified . We were n't expecting a war . We thought we were fighting a war of attrition , but what we did n't expect was for them to turn on us . They never saw us coming , and we never expected them to attack us . We tried to hide , but the aliens were too quick . They had us surrounded . We retreated , and as the aliens began to get closer we were able to escape . We found ourselves in the middle of a field . We could see the ships , and the ships were moving at a snail 's pace . We had to escape , but we had to be fast . We knew the aliens could n't keep up with us . Our ships were being attacked . We ran . We did n' t know what to do , but our ships were n 't going to be able to keep up . We started running . We saw a planet in the distance . It was a beautiful planet . It had a beautiful sunset . We yelled for the aliens to stop . They did n ' t . We only had one chance to escape before they caught up . The ships were speeding towards us . The humans were the last thing we needed . We rushed forward , and then we saw the aliens . We felt their wrath . They came from the sky , and were speeding toward us . I knew they were coming . We 'd be in trouble . We should n't have taken them . We abandoned the ship . We made our way to the surface . We reached the surface , and saw the alien ships , but they were too fast . They ran at us . My ship was too slow . I was too late . I 'd made it . We fell into a crater . I saw a ship come in . It looked like it was a small ship , but it was too fast for me to get out . I had to get to the other side . I turned around . It did n ’ t look like it had any weapons . It just had a few weapons . I could n 've gotten away , but there was a ship that was too close . I jumped out of the way . The ship was still moving , and I saw the ship come towards me . I swung my ship around , and it did n’ t hit it .

It felt like I was in a hospital . I got up , and looked around . There was no one around . The only thing I could see was a room with a few other people .

I was late to work because of a stoppage on the 6 train out of Murray Hill , my computer crashed right in the middle of my weekly marketing projections , and some asshole ate my deconstructed quinoa salad . Also I was hit by a Winnebago on my way to visit a Keffir cleansing clinic somewhere in Greenwich . How the Hell a Winnebago got into Manhattan , I have no idea , but I thought it would n't matter because I was dead . West Side Highway ; that had to be how they got here . Anyway , being dead , you can imagine how shocked I was to wake up inside said Winnebago . Also , as I looked out the window , I saw fields of corn and ... I do n't know ... Soybeans , maybe ? Well , it certainly was n't Midtown . `` Good morning ! '' a high , squeaky voice called from behind me , scaring the shit out of me . `` I see that you 're finally back from Central Afterlife Processing ; do you have your 12-324-A with affixed disposition statement ? '' I stared blankly at a pale , scrawny woman wearing clothing that had to be a hundred years out of fashion . She had a white bonnet and was covered in blood , her throat obviously torn apart . `` Wolves , '' she simply replied , `` but I have to take people 's word on it ; you 'll soon discover that you ca n't see your reflection anywhere . Your form ? '' `` Am I ... Am I dead ? ! '' I shouted . `` Quite . And from the look of it -- '' she pointed at my face -- `` you definitely saw it coming . '' I felt my face all over , to no avail . It was like feeling air . That 's when I suddenly noticed that I could n't feel the ground beneath me , or the clothes against my skin . There was nothing to smell , and it struck me that I was n't breathing , either . `` Holy shit , I 'm actually ... dead ... . '' `` Yes . As for the form , '' she continued politely , `` you 'll find it in your shirt pocket . '' I reached in and produced a small , yellowing scroll , sealed in blood-red wax . I slowly handed it to her , still reeling from the realization that I really , truly had died . And that I was on a Winnebago . A thought occurred to me : I turned to the driver 's area . But instead of the elderly couple who were the last living faces I ever saw , there were two women , probably in their early thirties . `` This is the RV that hit me , right ? '' `` Oh yes . According to your disposition statement , the last words you ever uttered as a living creature were -- and I quote -- 'damn it all to Hell ' . '' So the processor decided to damn this vehicle by having you haunt it . '' `` Forever ? ! '' I cried , not relishing an eternity in a Winnebago . Oh heavens no , '' she chuckled . `` Only until it is destroyed . After that , you get to disappear into eternal rest . '' `` Oh ... Well , that does n't sound so bad . How do I haunt this ? '' She simply shrugged her shoulders . `` Not my department . I just process the 12-324 forms . I 'm sure you 'll figure something out . My advice is just to focus on one thing , do n't try to do too much . '' She stood up from the bed and gave me a thumbs-up . `` Best of luck to you , sir . '' `` Hold on , '' I said . `` How long have you been doing ... All this ? '' She grimaced , her face screwed up in concentration . `` One hundred ninety-eight years . Only two to go . '' `` Why so long ? '' `` The money 's good , '' she stated simply . And in an instant , she was gone . ~~~ The funny thing is , Melissa and Juliet were really cool people . Sure , the first day was awful . I 'd tried everything I could think of : screaming as loud and as long as possible ( you can shout until the sound of your own voice annoys you , saying as you do n't need to breathe ) , banging on walls ( you 'll actually push yourself through solid material before you make a sound ) , and making things go haywire ( I can affect small electronics and electrical systems , but the worst I did was give the radio a bit of static ) . By the end if the third week , I was exhausted , mentally if not physically . While I did n't need sleep , I still took naps to alleviate the boredom . I slept on the floor of the Winnebago since I could n't feel discomfort anymore . I had been sleeping on the bed out of habit , but the second night I 'd woken up to them having sex . Even though I was dead , I thought they should have a bit of privacy . I learned a lot about them , being forced to listen to their conversations . They 'd bought the Winnebago from the old couple who 'd killed me , and were driving to Portland . Melissa had a ten-year-old daughter at a private school there who Juliet was in the process of adopting . They were both allergic to cats and loved country music . ( I never said it was a fun trip . ) I ended up not trying to haunt the Winnebago anymore ; not only was it futile , but I had a lot of reading to catch up on . Did you know that when authors die , they 're given the option to keep writing ? In fact , I was on the twenty-fifth book in the *Lord of the Rings* series ( the one where Gimli 's grandsons journey back to Middle Earth to rescue a kidnapped Legolas ) when I finally figured out how to haunt the damned Winnebago . By accident , no less . Melissa 's ( and Juliet 's at this point ) daughter Madysynn was along for a drive up to Seattle . Juliet was standing near me , making sandwiches in the kitchenette . Madysynn turned around in the passenger seat and shouted `` smile ! '' I was caught by surprise as she snapped a photo with an old-fashioned Polaroid instant camera . Thinking nothing of it , I continued reading as two of the grandsons sang a lamentation over the body of the third . `` Hey , look at that , '' Madysynn said . `` Does that look like a guy 's face ? '' I froze instantly . No way ... . I got up and crept to where she and Juliet were sitting , watching as the photo developed . Juliet appeared slowly , holding a sandwich and grinning . And sure enough , right where I was sitting , there was a vague , blurry form of a person . There was no detail to it at all , just an outline and two dark circles for eyes . If I had n't personally been sitting there , even I would n't have guessed it was me . `` Ehh , '' Juliet said , `` it 's probably just a bad spot on the film . It 's got ta be 20 years old by now . '' Madysynn looked disappointed . `` How do you know it 's not a ghost ? '' she asked . Melissa laughed . `` How on earth would an RV be haunted ? '' `` I do n't know , '' Madysynn replied , `` maybe it hit someone and they died . '' Melissa and Juliet both went ghostly pale . `` Holy crap ! '' Madysynn exclaimed , seeing the looks on their faces . `` Did someone really die ? ! '' `` Maddy , honey , '' Juliet finally said , `` there 's no such thing as ghosts .

The humans were n't going to be able to help it . `` Just let me tell you a story . '' He said , taking a step back . `` A story about a *humans* . '' A human , a human . The earthlings were n 't really the same . The human was a *creature* , a *people* . They were the *creatures* of the earth . They had no other reason to exist . `` And what are you , a* species ?

He was looking around the chamber , his lips moving in a wide smile . `` ... and you ? '' he asked , his face turning red . `` Yes , '' he said , `` I am a human !

But also a warning , as stories we tell often hold . Before time began there was nothing . With the advent of time , little bits of the ether began to clump together as they never been able to do without time . This led to a great build-up of matter . But this was not any matter such as earth or flesh , neigh . ‘ Twas an ethereal matter that in its nubile form that had never contacted other matter , even of its own kind . This build up soon reached a point where the milk of the universe could not support its own weight . Thus it curdled into a new form . As nature is perfect , and the perfect form is a circle : it formed the Sacred Wheel of Cheese . Aye , a truly beautiful spectacle to behold if there had been eyes to see it with . When the stars were born of the wafting wondrous odor , the world of its flawless rind : all was right . But then from somewhere in the darkness they came . Make of the same blackness that was not shone in the light of the Cheese , crows and ravens . They slashed and hacked at the noble Fromage , only to be rebuffed by the glorious inhabitants of the rind . Their feathers , purified by the Cheese ’ s curds , fell to the rind to make the continents , and their life-sauce made from the colourless and black became the seas and oceans . Yes I know that they ’ re blue… Stop punching your brother… No , I am not making this up… The reason all of the water is blue is because the Cheese had a secret . It formed like a raindrop , a raindrop is not all water . It starts from one of the smallest specks of dust then as water comes to it , it can become larger . So , what was it that the glorious Cheese formed around ? A blue gem . There are no stories of where it came from or if someone put it there , but we know that it was there . When those ravagers saw it , they fell upon it with more gusto than they had to the cheese . This was their undoing , as the stone began to shake and shiver it drew those terrible beasts near to it . Then as a final gift to the world , the stone tore itself to pieces in a flash of energy and light . Those shadow creatures were destroyed along with the gem , spreading its blue essence to our sky and water . The cheese was scattered everywhere , landing on our humble rind , in the grim void . But one large piece stayed with us as a companion . Still if you look up , you can see its battle scars . I have carried this story for many years , children , now I must warn you . Do not believe the vendors when they tell stories of how their suppliers retrieved the cheese from a grand old cow . All cheese is descended from the Cheese , and the supplier hacks away in mines where the cheese came to rest all those aeons ago . So children do you think that we should waste this cheese ? Of course not ! This children is why you are gifted with a half-gram of cheese a week .': '5 5 5 5 3', \"As humans , we believed we were independent . That we controlled the course of our own lives . So when the overlords we did n't know we had came to collect us , we felt defiant . And scared . Everything we thought we knew about the universe was wrong . Our far fetched theories of how we were made were cast aside . Instead of the Big Bang , we had been told we were only lab specimens . *Seeded* were the exact words they used . This statement only pushed our thoughts of defiance and independence to knew levels . In fact , we were blinded with rage . We threw everything we had at them . Maybe that 's what led to our downfall . Our militaries were swatted aside like flies . Wreckage rained from the skies . Our petty war lasted a day . Earth weeped for the loss of the its rights . We were prepared to be enslaved , or even annihilated as a whole . Instead , after losing our war , we were cast into a new war . We had to fight for the aliens that had conquered us . The overlords told us that we either fight , or our children would be burned . We either fight , or our home planet would be mined until it was a carcass of its former self . So we did the only thing we could . We fought . The have sent us away with their technology to fight a war that was meaningless to us . We fought a war knowing that *we* were meaningless .

Thankfully , he was n't too far down the rabbit hole , and I would n't have to force feed him water . I 've definetely done that more than once with a Tripee . `` Uncle Steve ... why are all the walls breathing ? '' `` Well , Alexander , you remember when you ate those Gummi Bears out of my mini-fridge ? Well , those were meant for me , because they are dangerous if eaten by an 11 year old ! '' `` AM I GUNNDIE ? ? ? '' Perked up the now frantic child . *Great choice of words , let 's scare the shit out of the 11 year old on acid . * `` No buddy , they 're just ... . special ! They let you see things that are n't actually there , like a TV in your head ! '' I quickly explained . `` It 'll last a few hours , and then you 'll be normal ! '' `` That 's ... super coooooooooooool ! '' he exclaimed `` Why is it dangerouss ? '' `` Well , buddy , sometimes you see scary things , but it 's okay , I 'm here , and I 'll help you out ! Now , why do n't we color and draw , and everything will be just fine ! '' What else could I say ? That that amount of dosage has brought grown men to tears ? My only solice is that LSD tends to show you an unfiltered , uneffected view on reality . While it does induce hallucinations , they are usually very mild , and are similar to a child 's imagination . Most people think you see things that are n't there , but the most you usually walk away with is a different lighting , some trails , and a more open mind . I almost envied him , thinking of all the things I could have learned tripping at his age . And then , it happened . Tears started errupting from the childs face , as he screamed `` NOOOOOOOOOO , DO N'T TOUCH ME ! ! ! '' at a nearby lamp shade , knocking it on to the ground . `` Alexander , it 's fine , you 're just ... just ... . dreaming ! With your eyes open ! Close your eyes , and you 'll feel better ! '' That did n't work . The moment Alexander closed his eyes , he immediatly curled in to a ball , and started yelling `` Make them go away , make the faces go away ! '' . I knew I had to act fast . There 's only one way we 're going to get through this night , and it was if I took him to his room , a safe place . `` Okay buddy , come with me , we 're gon na go to your room , they ca n't get you there ! '' I said , albiet , pleading more than asking . What happened next , I will never forget for the rest of my life . Almost as if someone had yanked a rope attatched to his sternum , Alexander popped up . From the depths of his throat , he released a screech , so inhumane , I harldy believed it came out of him . `` nnnnnnyyYYAAAAAAAAAARGGHHHHHHHHH ! ! ! ! ! ! '' the now airborn kid screamed , as he jumped off of my bed , and straight in to my stomach , knocking me down . Then , he bolted up , and ran immediatelly out the door . And then , silence . Now , I do n't know if you 've ever tripped with an 11 year old before . If you have , I do n't judge , but maybe your situation was similar to mine . Silence is NEVER a good thing with kids , let alone tripping ones . So , as I ran out , I came face to face with what could only be described as horrific . There Alexander was , panting , stark naked in the corner of the living room . How he had managed to get his clothes off before I came in , beats me . But , things were n't getting any better from there . Not only did I have a naked 11 year old psychonaught to deal with , but now I could see his Mom , my sister , pulling up in the driveway . Only one thing came to mind . *I 'm Fucked* .\": '5 5 3 5 5', \"I wake up , feeling the cold metal of the knife in my arm .

Best described as snail-like sentients , the Aluumu were slow-moving pseudo-molluscs who had developed a sort of organic technology that had allowed them to venture into space . They were old - about 10 billion years older than humanity - yet their technology was just barely beyond our own . But the most astonishing fact was that they did n't understand the concept of *weapons* . Human xenobiologists and xenoanthropologists who studied the Aluumu homeworld were stunned to find a culture and ecosystem that *did not have predators* . This sort of biological harmony meant that the species shared genetics freely across various animals and the Aluumu were actually massive colonies of different species - similar to our terrestrial Chondrophores . At the very basic level , everything on the planet Aluu ingested only inorganic or decaying matter , the lowest organisms converting the matter through to the higher organisms in a beautiful chain of complex biochemistry that left many of our xenobiologists irritatingly excitable . The other problem ( for the Aluumu ) was that they had no concept of *selfishness* . Coming from a global system that only *benefited* from total altruism , they did not understand the human capacity for moral ambiguity - and were therefore easily taken advantage of . Lacking any concept of conflict and finding the concept of war terrifyingly incomprehensible , they ignored our differences and tried to 'integrate ' us into their species by altruistically seeding us with genetic information ; to not only bring about biological perfection by freeing us of disease , but to 'soothe the savage beast ' within us and remove our dominant , violent traits . Humanity , of course , saw this as an attack . The Aluumu had been in contact with many other sentient , space-faring species , as we discovered from their records . What remained of the species after the Aluumu 'wars ' amounted to nothing more than a handful of individuals who were kept in research facilities and used for advanced genetic research . From them , humanity learned to program itself into a biologically superior organism . Like the Aluumu , most of the other alien species had no concept of war , or it had died out in their very ancient past . Organic life in the galaxy , it seemed , was far less like us and far more like the snail-creatures we had practically exterminated . Primed by the terror of the Aluumu 'wars ' , where vast portions of humanity had been 'infected ' with a 'zombie virus ' that made us slow-moving , affable and selflessly co-operative to the point of docility , the Earth corporations who controlled our resource-stripped planet saw an opportunity to demonstrate what would become the defining feature of our species - unbridled greed . Behaving like mobile insect colonies , the Idri were the next to fall , then the Palacatalata - city-sized super organisms comprising of billions of trillions of cooperative single-celled entities . Both put up a token resistance , but both fell quickly to the scourge of humanity . Panicking , the galactic community convened and elected the Rovak - the only other race with a vaguely war-like history - to head their battle fleets . But humanity , having taken such pleasure in genetically engineering super-soldiers and reverse-engineering alien biotech , had built massive , unstoppable juggernauts in preparation for what we saw as an 'inevitable ' conflict with another species like ourselves . To say the war was one-sided is being generous . It was a massacre to make previous human genocides feel comforting and benign . Aided by the hideous , arachnid appearance of the Rovak and an 'insurmountable ' language barrier , the human troops thought they were simply making pre-emptive strikes against an aggressor hell-bent on wiping us out . Certainly it looked that way to the average citizen - planet after planet of newly-built alien military outposts , strategically positioned against Earth and its colonies . Fearing an end in the same manner as the Aluumu , the Idri and the Palacatalata , the galactic races surrendered to humanity and begged for their lives . In the aftermath , we sit here , rulers of the galaxy , virtual Terror Gods to these gentle , placid aliens . Aliens who learned the art of war far too late ; just as we learned the art of *peace* far too late . Humanity is treated with such deference and reverence on the alien populated worlds that it is *embarrassing* to step foot on whatever passes for their streets . Even the remnants of the Rovak species grovel , flip themselves on their back and present their furry , vulnerable underbellies to us , showing we are the dominant species . Other races , like the Yu , will simply commit mass ritual suicide on sight of a human being , so we can not even set foot on their worlds . The damage we have done to this galaxy is utterly beyond repair . There is no way back from this ; even should humanity become like the Yu and commit massive , galactic suicide , the other races will never recover what they once had . They are too frail , too fearful and too broken . As we harness the last technologies of the elder races and our collective eye turns outward from the Milky Way , I fear for the rest of the universe . *- Allison Hale , Xenobiologist*\": '5 5 5 5 4', \"I was walking down the street , my feet feeling the cold , wet pavement of the sidewalk . I was taking a break from my daily routine to take a walk , when I saw a woman emerge from behind a nearby water source . She was wearing a black coat and a black hat , with a black scarf . She looked like she was about to pass out , but she stopped and turned around . `` Hello , '' she said . `` I 'm the woman you came to see . I 've come to see you . '' I looked at her , confused . `` What 's going on ? '' I asked . `` You have a new object , '' the woman said . I looked around . There were no other people around . I followed her . She walked to the water source , and opened the bottle of water . I watched as she drank it , and then she turned around and started walking away . I stood there , dumbfounded . She turned back , and I saw her face . `` Why are you here ? '' she asked . I felt my heart start pounding . `` Because I 'd like to see your face .

I asked him . `` My name is Nathaniel , '' he said . He was wearing glasses , and he looked like a man who had been through a lot . `` Are you Nathaniel ? '' He asked . The man looked at me , and said , `` I am . '' He looked at the water . `` And what is it ? '' The man asked . His voice was low , and his eyes were red . `` It 's a sword . '' he replied . I laughed , and looked at him . He laughed . `` Now , I have a sword ? '' This was the first time I had ever heard of a sword , and it was the most interesting thing I had seen . `` Yes , '' I said . The woman said , looking at me . `` How do you know ? '' She asked . She handed me the sword . I took it , but it was too heavy . I thought it was a sword and it seemed to be very heavy . `` Do you know how to use it ? `` , I asked , and a smile came over my face . The stranger looked at my face , and smiled . `` The sword is a sword of the gods , '' it said .\": '2 3 2 0 0', \"It was about noon in my dunghole of an office when it happened . I had just loosened my tie and drawn my state-issued dagger given to interpreters of the law , and my underpaid intern ( whom which I had no idea why she bothered to stick around ) had equipped her shoes in her hand , the two of us cornering a fairly large basilisk-cockroach , when someone opened the door . I looked up at the door in surprise , as normally criminals tended to want to pay off the crown or take the axe , and the basilisk-cockroach grasped the opportunity and slithered away into the gap between tables . My intern lunged for it , with a large smack hit the floor and continued to slide until her head hit the end of one of the tables , all the while I gazed at the figure stepping in from the dusty blue-gray sunlight . `` Royal State Lawyer Isiah Joneson ? '' asked the man that I now recogized as a baliff sent by the upper levels of our uncaring government , recogized mostly by the obvious gilded trims on his jacket . I sheathed my cheap ceremonial dagger at my side and hastily fixed my tie as I approached the man . `` Present , '' I replied . `` Ah , '' he began , `` Fantastic . The Royal Court has appointed you the lawyer of a new defendant . '' He thrust what I assumed was a summons to me , rolled and sealed with red wax stamped with the royal seal . `` Under penalty of losing the powers bestowed to you by the Royal Court , you are obligated to- '' `` Yes , yes , you do n't have to recite the whole damned thing . '' I waved irritably at him , but he seemed relieved . He bowed stiffly , as apparently a man living in a basilisk-cockroach dump of a stone-bricked office was officially higher rank than a decorated man that walked the streets with paudrons of gold thread . `` The Royal Court appreciates your service , '' he said stiffly . And then he was gone , back out into the dusty blue-grey sunlight outside . My intern stood up shakily , holding onto the table for balance , and brushing a loose hair back behind her ear . `` What is it this time , '' she inquired , `` Another smart-mouthed treasonist ? '' `` I hope not , '' I breathed as I slid over to my desk to look for my letter opener . Unable to find it , I drew my knife ( which by the way should never be used in any of the ways I have used it thus far ) and cut the wax seal in half . `` Ah , '' I said , beginning to read the parchment as I unrolled it . `` It seems we shall be representing a smart-mouthed dragon instead . '' Today was looking up . -- -- `` Now Mister- '' `` Drop the mistur . Druk , I prefer . '' The dragon 's voice shook the fireproof , scratchproof , shatterproof , smashproof , and generally dragonproof ( though strangely not musketproof so I heard ) sheet of glass that separated us . The voice of the dragon carried through the glass , but I held a phone with my shoulder as I scrambled through my notes and papers of ancients laws that my intern had helped prepare . Truthfully , the dragon was a much better student of the law than I , having been present when it was made , but it seemed the Royal Court outlawed self-representation in front of a judge . As it was , I was to represent this dragon and try to make a case for him . `` Druk , then . You 've been accused of hundreds of accounts of manslaughter , more cases of assault , '' I paused at one of the claimes , `` Apparently a single case of sexual harassment - '' `` I will admit to that one , '' Druk huffed with a swirl of smoke . I looked up at him , and it very definitely seemed like he was smiling . `` Anyways , those and the unfathamable amount of property damage . '' `` Ever hear of insurance fraud ? '' he huffed with another rumble . My quill tipped over with the shaking . I quickly snatched it back up before it splotched over all my notes . `` Well , regardless , I do n't see a way to dismiss all the charges or get you out of this . '' I sighed as I adjusted my tie and switched shoulders for the phone . `` Some of the murders I can get you off of by using the Vigilante Ruling of 812 , which will get you about a month of prison for offense , but these are human lives here . '' I put my notes down and locked eyes with him . His huge reptilian eyes squinted back at me . `` We could use an insanity defense , but I ca n't in good conscience let you fly free , not when you 're accused of taking this many lives . '' `` No . '' I recoiled in my uncomfortable dungeon chair . `` What no ? '' `` I did not do any of it , '' was the rumbled snarl , accompanied with a spot of flame . I sat in disbelief at what I was hearing . `` Could you repeat that for me ? '' I asked meekly . `` I am innocent of it all , and I can prove it . '' -- -- The first day at the Royal Court , I found myself a nervous wreck in the washroom . There were crews of newscasters with their live cameras and crystal balls all trying to push into the building , trying to get a piece of the best scoop of the century . It was cacophonaic chaos . My intern was busy going through some final notes with the dragon . It had been a very busy few weeks , leading up to this heartpounding moment , but the quiet of the washroom calmed me . I splashed more water into my face . `` You can do this , '' I confidently assured the face in the mirror . I stood up and attempted to fix my tie again . Satisfied , I turned and found myself face-to-face with a member of the royam family , whom I had n't noticed come in . `` Prince Tyran ! '' I nearly screamed . He smiled back at me as he took off his gloves . `` Isiah . Hello . '' He smiled . `` Quite the event today for you , is n't it ? '' I did n't like his smooth voice . `` What do you want , milord ? '' I tried to ask kindly . `` Oh , to the point . I do suppose , yes , you are short on time . '' He glanced to the door . `` Well , I shalll make this short . '' Like a whirling whirlstorm , he spun his sword out of sheath and to my neck , pushing me against the wall . `` The dragon is not to win . '' He hissed . `` You understand ? That dragon does not win , and I will not touch your life - or your intern 's . '' I pushed him off and carefully pulled the tip of his sword away . `` His name is Druk , '' I stated as I fixed my tie again , pushing out of the lixurious washroom into the mess of noise outside . -- -- I fingered the hilt of my dagger absently . Druk and my intern sat behind me expectantly . Druk somehow managed a subtle nod , something that I had thought previously impossible . I turned back to face the Royal Court seated high above me . At the forefront sat the Queen , her King seated to her right . Far to my left sat the Prince who had threatened me moments ago . His face had a gentle smile . I flashed him a small grin , and watched his face slowly turn to pure horror . I began . `` Your Grace , I will show to the Royal Court that , undoubtedly , my client , the dragon known as Druk , is completely innocent of all his crimes and without fault - '' The room exploded before I could finish . I continued , yelling above the excited talking . `` -Without fault for the crimes of the murder of two-thousand and ninety two citizens , without fault for the assault of seventeen-thousand and fourty citizens , without fault for the destruction of countless amounts of property across our fair kingdom , and that he has been in fact grossly misrepresented and slandered by the media , ( especially in the case of the hooker from the Capitol ) and that none of these acts were caused by him ! Rather ! I will prove to you that my client has been framed for these crimes ! '' The room was at a deafening volume at that . The prosecution asked the Royal Court that we would ajourn for the day . They granted the request .\": '4 5 5 5 5', 'The Lord of Hell rhythmically tapped the desktop as she pondered the mystery that has haunted Hell for past two centuries . The number of souls that dwelled within Hell was reaching zero , and the flow of souls to Hell had stopped . No current statistical interpretation could explain it ; nobody in the entirety of Hell could explain it . It irked her greatly . The last time she had been so baffled was when the number of souls damned per thousand had dropped in the nineteenth century , and stayed there.At first she had sought an explanation among the myriad of churches . Then she had realized that the change came from outside the church ! It had taken a millennium , but it seemed that humanity was slowly creating its own code of ethics , rather than using the Lord of Heaven ’ s . Something she certainly would not have bet on . Had humanity had finally learned something from Job ? The population of Hell was strongly correlated to the population of Earth . This was an unshakable trend for millennia . There would always be sinners , no matter how hard the social reformers worked , due to free will . The only way to rid the world of sinners was to rid the world of free will , and to rid the world of free will was also a sin . The only thing that would change would be the characters sent to Hell . And yet this was happening ! She was infuriated that she had lost another bet to the Lord of Heaven . What was even more grating was that she had no idea how it had happened . “ Your coffee , Mistress. ” Murmured a soft voice from behind . The imbecile should be grateful she didn ’ t vaporize him for having the audacity to enter her domain without knocking , but he was too useful to be killed , especially as there were few left in Hell . Instead she absentmindedly accepted the cup . Coffee was one of the few items imported from Earth . The ingenuity of humanity lately was astonishing , compared to a millenium before ... . The cup fell to the floor , ignored as she had an epipheny . Could it be ? ! She rushed downstairs to meet the few souls in Hell that remained . At the beginning , Hell was able to deal with the damned on a face-to-face basis . Her underlings made it a sport to figure out each soul ’ s psychology in order to administer the maximum amount of pain with the least of amount of effort . Hell in this era resembled the stereotype : chains , whips , and blood . Janitors were prized more than torturers in those days . However , around the twentieth century the population of Earth exploded , and thus the population of Hell exploded . At first she had stuck with the old methods , creating a waiting list to enter Hell ( possibly the most evil thing she had ever done ) Soon she realized Soon she realized Hell would have to adapt or its job would never be done . So Hell had automated suffering . Each soul received a small cell , and the environment was designed to make the inhabitant as miserable as possible . Loud noises for long-term sleep deprivation . Several varieties of pathogens , from severe nausea to fungi inhabiting the genitals . They were hung from the ceiling by their thumbs . They were nude . The worst was probably the perennial solitary confinement . Some of the mind games her underlings thought of disturbed even her . For the first time in centuries there was a devil in the same room as a human . To the Lord of Hell ’ s amusement , he looked pleased to see another face . That pleasure didn ’ t last , as the only thing she did before leaving was tear an arm off . Her hunch had been right . What had once been a being made of flesh , bone , and organs was now of metal , wires , and computers . She was torn between hysterical laughter and abject rage . For now she knew why the flow of souls to Hell had ceased . The dichotomy of Heaven and Hell only existed as long as humanity was born from the Hand of God . As they were now of metal rather than dust , Hell no longer had a grip on their souls . Humanity had found a way to opt out of the latest bet between God and Satan . Just as God had predicted . Dammit . At least she had a way to get back at the bastard . Around the world , the following message was heard : `` We would like to announce that Hell is finally empty .
